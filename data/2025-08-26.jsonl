We introduce\nHemePLM-Diffuse, an innovative generative transformer model that is designed\nfor accurate simulation of protein-ligand trajectories, inpaints the missing\nligand fragments, and sample transition paths in systems with more than 10,000\natoms. HemePLM-Diffuse has features of SE(3)-Invariant tokenization approach\nfor proteins and ligands, that utilizes time-aware cross-attentional diffusion\nto effectively capture atomic motion. We also demonstrate its capabilities\nusing the 3CQV HEME system, showing enhanced accuracy and scalability compared\nto leading models such as TorchMD-Net, MDGEN, and Uni-Mol."}

Recently, Boltz-2 was proposed, achieving extremely\nhigh accuracy in binding affinity prediction, but requiring approximately 20\nseconds per compound per GPU, making it difficult to apply to large-scale\nscreening of hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds. This study\nproposes Boltzina, a novel framework that leverages Boltz-2's high accuracy\nwhile significantly improving computational efficiency. Boltzina achieves both\naccuracy and speed by omitting the rate-limiting structure prediction from\nBoltz-2's architecture and directly predicting affinity from AutoDock Vina\ndocking poses. We evaluate on eight assays from the MF-PCBA dataset and show\nthat while Boltzina performs below Boltz-2, it provides significantly higher\nscreening performance compared to AutoDock Vina and GNINA. Additionally,\nBoltzina achieved up to 11.8$\\times$ faster through reduced recycling\niterations and batch processing. Furthermore, we investigated multi-pose\nselection strategies and two-stage screening combining Boltzina and Boltz-2,\npresenting optimization methods for accuracy and efficiency according to\napplication requirements. This study represents the first attempt to apply\nBoltz-2's high-accuracy predictions to practical-scale screening, offering a\npipeline that combines both accuracy and efficiency in computational biology.\nThe Boltzina is available on github; https://github.com/ohuelab/boltzina."}

In this work, we take a step towards overcoming this limitation by\nproposing a framework to condition structure generation on flexibility, which\nis crucial for key functionalities such as catalysis or molecular recognition.\nWe first introduce BackFlip, an equivariant neural network for predicting\nper-residue flexibility from an input backbone structure. Relying on BackFlip,\nwe propose FliPS, an SE(3)-equivariant conditional flow matching model that\nsolves the inverse problem, that is, generating backbones that display a target\nflexibility profile. In our experiments, we show that FliPS is able to generate\nnovel and diverse protein backbones with the desired flexibility, verified by\nMolecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.

Since\nits discovery, equivalent sites in other K2P channels have been shown to bind\nvarious ligands, both endogenous and exogenous. In this review, we attempt to\nelucidate how the modulator pocket contributes to K2P channel activation. To\nthis end, we first describe the gating mechanisms reported in the literature\nand rationalize their modes of action. We then highlight previous experimental\nand computational evidence for agonists that bind to the modulator pocket,\ntogether with mutations at this site that affect gating. Finally, we elaborate\nhow the activation signal arising from the modulator pocket is transduced to\nthe gates in K2P channels. In doing so, we outline a potential common modulator\npocket architecture across K2P channels: a largely amphipathic structure\n-consistent with the expected properties of a pocket exposed at the interface\nbetween a hydrophobic membrane and the aqueous solvent- but still with some\nimportant channel-sequence-variations. This architecture and its key\ndifferences can be leveraged for the design of new selective and potent\nmodulators."}
