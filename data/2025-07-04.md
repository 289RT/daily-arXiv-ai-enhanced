  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AQP3在超渗透条件下对NPC凋亡的作用，为椎间盘退化的治疗提供新靶点。

Result: AQP3缺失导致NPC凋亡增加，而过表达AQP3可恢复信号通路并减轻损伤。

Conclusion: AQP3是椎间盘退化的潜在治疗靶点。

Abstract: Hyperosmolarity is a key contributor to nucleus pulposus cell (NPC) apoptosis
during intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). Aquaporin 3 (AQP3), a membrane
channel protein, regulates cellular osmotic balance by transporting water and
osmolytes. Although AQP3 downregulation is associated with disc degeneration,
its role in apoptosis under hyperosmotic conditions remains unclear. Here, we
demonstrate that hyperosmolarity induces AQP3 depletion, suppresses the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS
accumulation in NPCs. Lentiviral overexpression of AQP3 restores this pathway,
attenuates oxidative damage, and reduces apoptosis, preserving disc structure
in IVDD rat models. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of AQP3 exacerbates
ECM catabolism and NP tissue loss. Our findings reveal that AQP3 deficiency
under hyperosmolarity contributes to NPC apoptosis via suppression of
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, potentially creating a pathological cycle of disc
degeneration. These results highlight AQP3 as a promising therapeutic target
for IVDD.

*Ruofan Jin,Zaixi Zhang,Mengdi Wang,Le Cong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STELLA是一种自进化的AI代理，通过动态工具库和模板库自主学习，提高在生物医学领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据的快速增长和工具的碎片化导致研究环境复杂化，需要能够自适应的AI解决方案。

Method: STELLA采用多代理架构，包含动态工具库和自动生成工具的代理，能够持续优化自身能力。

Result: STELLA在多个生物医学基准测试中表现优异，性能随经验增长而提升。

Conclusion: STELLA证明了自适应AI代理在加速生物医学研究中的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

### [6] [Guided Generation for Developable Antibodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02670)
*Siqi Zhao,Joshua Moller,Porfi Quintero-Cadena,Lood van Niekerk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于离散扩散模型的抗体序列优化方法，结合软值解码模块（SVDD），以提高抗体的可开发性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高抗体的可开发性（包括制造性、稳定性和安全性），需要一种计算框架来优化抗体序列。

Method: 通过训练离散扩散模型，并结合自然抗体序列和临床抗体的可开发性数据，引入SVDD模块来指导生成生物物理可行的候选序列。

Result: 模型能够复现天然抗体库和已批准治疗抗体的全局特征，并在SVDD指导下显著提升预测的可开发性评分。

Conclusion: 该方法为同时满足结合和生物物理标准的抗体设计提供了一个迭代的机器学习驱动流程。

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

### [7] [Hierarchical Multi-Label Contrastive Learning for Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Across Organisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02724)
*Shiyi Liu,Buwen Liang,Yuetong Fang,Zixuan Jiang,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为HIPPO的分层对比学习框架，用于跨生物体的蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用（PPI）预测，通过多层次的生物表征匹配和层次对比损失函数，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，AI在科学领域的进展表明，对比学习在连接异质生物数据模态方面具有强大潜力。HIPPO的提出旨在解决蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用预测中的跨物种数据稀疏和不平衡问题。

Method: HIPPO采用分层对比学习框架，通过多层次生物表征匹配和层次对比损失函数，结合域和家族知识，自适应地学习蛋白质功能的固有层次结构。

Result: 实验表明，HIPPO在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有低数据稳健性和零样本跨物种迁移能力，能够在不重新训练的情况下预测其他物种的PPI。

Conclusion: HIPPO通过分层特征融合揭示了保守的相互作用决定因素，如结合基序和功能注释，为稀疏或多物种不平衡数据场景下的PPI预测提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.
