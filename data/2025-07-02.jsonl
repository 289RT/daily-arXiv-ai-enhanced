Both the auto-regressive generation paradigm and evaluation\nmetrics have been transferred from NLP to biological sequence modeling.\nHowever, the intrinsic structural correlations in natural and biological\nlanguages differ fundamentally. Therefore, we revisit the notion of language in\nbiological systems to better understand how NLP successes can be effectively\ntranslated to biological domains. By treating the 3D structure of biomolecules\nas the semantic content of a sentence and accounting for the strong\ncorrelations between residues or bases, we highlight the importance of\nstructural evaluation and demonstrate the applicability of the auto-regressive\nparadigm in biological language modeling.

In this\nwork we propose a new design of the spatial kernel matrix to improve\nreconstruction in fast and slow kinetics body regions. We calculate voxels\nfeatures using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with optimal rank\nselection. These features are then used to calculate similarities between\nvoxels considering relative differences between features to adapt to a wide\nrange of activity levels. Simulations and whole body mouse scans of high\ntemporal resolution [18F]SynVesT-1, low dose [11C]raclopride, and\n[18F]Fallypride were performed to assess the performance of the method in\ndifferent settings. In simulations, bias vs variance tradeoff and contrast was\nimproved using the NMF kernel matrix, compared with the original kernel method.\nIn real data, fast kinetic regions such as the heart, veins and kidneys\npresented oversmoothing or artifacts with the original kernel method. Our\nproposed method did not present these effects, while reducing noise. Brain\nkinetic modeling parametric maps with image derived input function\n([18F]SynVesT-1) and with reference region ([11C]raclopride and\n[18F]Fallypride) also had lower standard error using the proposed kernel matrix\ncompared with other methods. The NMF kernel reconstruction reduces noise and\nmaintains high contrast in whole body PET imaging, outperforming the\ntraditional kernel method."}
