Though recent deep learning (DL) methods have substantially advanced predictions of single protein structures, computationally modeling conformational ensembles remains a challenge. Here, we focus on modeling fold-switching proteins, which remodel their secondary and/or tertiary structures and change their functions in response to cellular stimuli. These underrepresented members of the protein universe serve as test cases for a method's generalizability. They reveal that DL models often predict conformational ensembles by association with training-set structures, limiting generalizability. These observations suggest use cases for when DL methods will likely succeed or fail. Developing computational methods that successfully identify new fold-switching proteins from large pools of candidates may advance modeling conformational ensembles more broadly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u6298\u53e0\u8f6c\u6362\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5176\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u867d\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6298\u53e0\u8f6c\u6362\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u7ec4\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u6298\u53e0\u8f6c\u6362\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6210\u529f\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u7528\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u8054\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u5019\u9009\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u6298\u53e0\u8f6c\u6362\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u3002"}}

Achieving controlled drug release from LAIs requires extensive optimization of the complex underlying physicochemical properties. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate LAI development by modeling the complex relationships between LAI properties and drug release. However, recent ML studies have provided limited information on key properties that modulate drug release, due to the lack of custom modeling and analysis tailored to LAI data. This paper presents a novel data transformation and explainable ML approach to synthesize actionable information from 321 LAI formulations by predicting early drug release at 24, 48, and 72 hours, classification of release profile types, and prediction of complete release profiles. These three experiments investigate the contribution and control of LAI material characteristics in early and complete drug release profiles. A strong correlation (>0.65) is observed between the true and predicted drug release in 72 hours, while a 0.87 F1-score is obtained in classifying release profile types. A time-independent ML framework predicts delayed biphasic and triphasic curves with better performance than current time-dependent approaches. Shapley additive explanations reveal the relative influence of material characteristics during early and for complete release which fill several gaps in previous in-vitro and ML-based studies. The novel approach and findings can provide a quantitative strategy and recommendations for scientists to optimize the drug-release dynamics of LAI. The source code for the model implementation is publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u805a\u5408\u7269\u957f\u6548\u6ce8\u5c04\u5242\uff08LAIs\uff09\u7684\u836f\u7269\u91ca\u653e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u6750\u6599\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u91ca\u653e\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u6548\u6ce8\u5c04\u5242\uff08LAIs\uff09\u5728\u6162\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u836f\u7269\u91ca\u653e\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9LAI\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b24\u300148\u548c72\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u836f\u7269\u91ca\u653e\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u91ca\u653e\u66f2\u7ebf\u7c7b\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u6d4b\u5b8c\u6574\u91ca\u653e\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86321\u79cdLAI\u914d\u65b9\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c72\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u836f\u7269\u91ca\u653e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8d85\u8fc70.65\uff0c\u91ca\u653e\u66f2\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u4e3a0.87\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u65e0\u5173\u7684ML\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53cc\u76f8\u548c\u4e09\u76f8\u66f2\u7ebf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u4f53\u5916\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4f18\u5316LAI\u7684\u836f\u7269\u91ca\u653e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5efa\u8bae\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u3002"}}

Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention. We show that science and art are generative acts of world-building under constraint, with vibration as a shared grammar organizing structure across scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "materiomusic\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u5c06\u7269\u8d28\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u97f3\u4e50\u903b\u8f91\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u827a\u672f\u7684\u5171\u901a\u6027", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u7269\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u97f3\u4e50\u521b\u4f5c\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u827a\u672f\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u521b\u65b0", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u9006\u6620\u5c04\u5c06\u5206\u5b50\u632f\u52a8\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u7f51\u7edc\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u97f3\u8c03\u548c\u4e50\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7AI\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u4e50", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u4e0e\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u71b5\u8d70\u5eca\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "conclusion": "\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u827a\u672f\u662f\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u632f\u52a8\u662f\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u6cd5"}}
