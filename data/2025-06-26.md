Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) that respect E(3) symmetries have
achieved strong performance on small molecule modeling, but they face
scalability and expressiveness challenges when applied to large biomolecules
such as RNA and proteins. These systems require models that can simultaneously
capture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across
spatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure,
such as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains.
Existing geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either
Euclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture
both the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware
dependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large
biomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant
Network that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and
Spherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware
features. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a
novel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate
atomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling
efficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems.
DualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing
benchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms
prior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating
its broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks.

Abstract: Template-based molecular generation offers a promising avenue for drug design
by ensuring generated compounds are synthetically accessible through predefined
reaction templates and building blocks. In this work, we tackle three core
challenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2)
scaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small
fragment sets. We propose \textbf{Recursive Cost Guidance}, a backward policy
framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate
synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost
synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular
diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an \textbf{Exploitation
Penalty} that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To
enhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a
\textbf{Dynamic Library} mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states
to construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art
results in template-based molecular generation.

Conclusion: ProCaliper为蛋白质功能研究提供了集成化的工具，开源且易于使用，有助于提高研究效率。

Abstract: Understanding protein function at the molecular level requires connecting
residue-level annotations with physical and structural properties. This can be
cumbersome and error-prone when functional annotation, computation of
physico-chemical properties, and structure visualization are separated. To
address this, we introduce ProCaliper, an open-source Python library for
computing and visualizing physico-chemical properties of proteins. It can
retrieve annotation and structure data from UniProt and AlphaFold databases,
compute residue-level properties such as charge, solvent accessibility, and
protonation state, and interactively visualize the results of these
computations along with user-supplied residue-level data. Additionally,
ProCaliper incorporates functional and structural information to construct and
optionally sparsify networks that encode the distance between residues and/or
annotated functional sites or regions. The package ProCaliper and its source
code, along with the code used to generate the figures in this manuscript, are
freely available at https://github.com/PNNL-Predictive-Phenomics/ProCaliper.

### [4] [Modelling Statistics of Polypeptides in Emissions from Smokers Near Ocean Ridges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20052)
*Ben Intoy,J. W. Halley*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了快速淬火过程在早期地球上可能如何通过非平衡化学反应促进生命起源，并通过实验和模型验证了这一假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究早期地球上快速淬火过程如何通过非平衡化学反应筛选出可能导致生命的化学物质。

Method: 通过实验室淬火实验和模型分析，结合海洋喷口样本的氨基酸和多肽数据，考虑氨基酸浓度的异质性。

Result: 实验和模型结果与从海洋喷口采集的多肽数据一致，支持喷口可能是非平衡多肽多样性来源的假设。

Conclusion: 海洋热液喷口可能是早期地球上非平衡多肽多样性的重要来源，为生命起源提供了潜在的孵化条件。

Abstract: We have previously shown in model studies that rapid quenches of systems of
monomers interacting to form polymer chains can fix nonequilibrium chemistries
which could lead to the origin of life. We suggested that such quenching
processes might have occurred at very high rates on early earth, giving an
efficient mechanism for natural sorting through enormous numbers of
nonequilibrium chemistries from which those most likely to lead to life could
be naturally selected. Taking account of kinetic barriers, we found good
agreement between laboratory quenching experiments on solutions of amino acids
and the resulting model. We also made a preliminary comparison between reported
data on polypeptides sampled from emissions from smokers near ocean ridges and
our model. However that previous model assumed that the concentrations of all
monomeric amino acids in the medium were the same whereas that is not the case
in samples taken from ocean smokers. Here we take account of the heterogeneous
concentrations of the amino acid monomers in the medium in the analysis of the
smoker data and compare the results with the data on polypeptide concentrations
found in the samples taken by a submersible in the Marianna Trough. Results are
consistent with the hypothesis that smokers were the source of large and
extremely diverse number of polypeptides in thermal disequilibrium which could
incubate processes leading to life.

### [5] [PocketVina Enables Scalable and Highly Accurate Physically Valid Docking through Multi-Pocket Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20043)
*Ahmet Sarigun,Bora Uyar,Vedran Franke,Altuna Akalin*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: PocketVina是一个快速且内存高效的分子对接框架，通过结合口袋预测和多口袋系统探索，在物理有效对接方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分子对接中物理有效配体结合姿态采样的挑战，特别是对于未见或结构多样的目标。

Method: 结合口袋预测与系统性多口袋探索，开发了PocketVina框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在物理有效性（PB-valid）和多样性目标上优于深度学习基线。

Conclusion: PocketVina提供了一个高效且无需特定训练的对接策略，适用于高通量虚拟筛选和药物发现。

Abstract: Sampling physically valid ligand-binding poses remains a major challenge in
molecular docking, particularly for unseen or structurally diverse targets. We
introduce PocketVina, a fast and memory-efficient, search-based docking
framework that combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket
exploration. We evaluate PocketVina across four established
benchmarks--PDBbind2020 (timesplit and unseen), DockGen, Astex, and
PoseBusters--and observe consistently strong performance in sampling physically
valid docking poses. PocketVina achieves state-of-the-art performance when
jointly considering ligand RMSD and physical validity (PB-valid), while
remaining competitive with deep learning-based approaches in terms of RMSD
alone, particularly on structurally diverse and previously unseen targets.
PocketVina also maintains state-of-the-art physically valid docking accuracy
across ligands with varying degrees of flexibility. We further introduce
TargetDock-AI, a benchmarking dataset we curated, consisting of over 500000
protein-ligand pairs, and a partition of the dataset labeled with PubChem
activity annotations. On this large-scale dataset, PocketVina successfully
discriminates active from inactive targets, outperforming a deep learning
baseline while requiring significantly less GPU memory and runtime. PocketVina
offers a robust and scalable docking strategy that requires no task-specific
training and runs efficiently on standard GPUs, making it well-suited for
high-throughput virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery.
