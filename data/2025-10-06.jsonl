Ghahremanpour", "Emilia Sługocka", "Filipe Menezes", "Djork-Arné Clevert"], "title": "FLOWR.root: A flow matching based foundation model for joint multi-purpose structure-aware 3D ligand generation and affinity prediction", "categories": ["q-bio.BM", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "We present Flowr.root, an equivariant flow-matching model for pocket-aware 3D\nligand generation with joint binding affinity prediction and confidence\nestimation. The model supports de novo generation, pharmacophore-conditional\nsampling, fragment elaboration, and multi-endpoint affinity prediction (pIC50,\npKi, pKd, pEC50). Training combines large-scale ligand libraries with\nmixed-fidelity protein-ligand complexes, followed by refinement on curated\nco-crystal datasets and parameter-efficient finetuning for project-specific\nadaptation. Flowr.root achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional\n3D molecule generation and pocket-conditional ligand design, producing\ngeometrically realistic, low-strain structures. The integrated affinity\nprediction module demonstrates superior accuracy on the SPINDR test set and\noutperforms recent models on the Schrodinger FEP+/OpenFE benchmark with\nsubstantial speed advantages. As a foundation model, Flowr.root requires\nfinetuning on project-specific datasets to account for unseen\nstructure-activity landscapes, yielding strong correlation with experimental\ndata. Joint generation and affinity prediction enable inference-time scaling\nthrough importance sampling, steering molecular design toward higher-affinity\ncompounds. Case studies validate this: selective CK2alpha ligand generation\nagainst CLK3 shows significant correlation between predicted and\nquantum-mechanical binding energies, while ERalpha and TYK2 scaffold\nelaboration demonstrates strong agreement with QM calculations. By integrating\nstructure-aware generation, affinity estimation, and property-guided sampling,\nFlowr.root provides a comprehensive foundation for structure-based drug design\nspanning hit identification through lead optimization."}

Yet how and what these\nRNA Language Models internally encode about messenger RNA (mRNA) or non-coding\nRNA (ncRNA) families remains unclear. We present SAE- RNA, interpretability\nmodel that analyzes RiNALMo representations and maps them to known human-level\nbiological features. Our work frames RNA interpretability as concept discovery\nin pretrained embeddings, without end-to-end retraining, and provides practical\ntools to probe what RNA LMs may encode about ncRNA families. The model can be\nextended to close comparisons between RNA groups, and supporting hypothesis\ngeneration about previously unrecognized relationships."}
