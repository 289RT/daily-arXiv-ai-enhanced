Motivation: 研究聚合马尔可夫模型的性质及其在离子通道机械建模中的应用，探讨模型可识别性问题。

Method: 通过Pólya枚举计算模型状态，分析非可识别性，并以三态模型为例详细研究。

Result: 发现超过特定参数数量的模型不可识别，建议基于额外数据构建模型。

Conclusion: 为避免不可识别性问题，应基于更直接的动态数据而非假设的过渡状态构建模型。

Abstract: Aggregated Markov models provide a flexible framework for stochastic dynamics
that develops on multiple timescales. For example, Markov models for ion
channels often consist of multiple open and closed state to account for "slow"
and "fast" openings and closings of the channel. The approach is a popular tool
in the construction of mechanistic models of ion channels - instead of viewing
model states as generators of sojourn times of a certain characteristic length,
each individual model state is interpreted as a representation of a distinct
biophysical state. We will review the properties of aggregated Markov models
and discuss the implications for mechanistic modelling. First, we show how the
aggregated Markov models with a given number of states can be calculated using
P\'olya enumeration However, models with $n_O$ open and $n_C$ closed states
that exceed the maximum number $2 n_O n_C$ of parameters are non-identifiable.
We will present two derivations for this classical result and investigate
non-identifiability further via a detailed analysis of the non-identifiable
fully connected three-state model. Finally, we will discuss the implications of
non-identifiability for mechanistic modelling of ion channels. We will argue
that instead of designing models based on assumed transitions between distinct
biophysical states which are modulated by ligand binding, it is preferable to
build models based on additional sources of data that give more direct insight
into the dynamics of conformational changes.

Conclusion: RNAGenScape为可控mRNA设计和潜空间探索提供了可扩展的范例。

Abstract: mRNA design and optimization are important in synthetic biology and
therapeutic development, but remain understudied in machine learning.
Systematic optimization of mRNAs is hindered by the scarce and imbalanced data
as well as complex sequence-function relationships. We present RNAGenScape, a
property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework that iteratively updates
mRNA sequences within a learned latent manifold. RNAGenScape combines an
organized autoencoder, which structures the latent space by target properties
for efficient and biologically plausible exploration, with a manifold projector
that contracts each step of update back to the manifold. RNAGenScape supports
property-guided optimization and smooth interpolation between sequences, while
remaining robust under scarce and undersampled data, and ensuring that
intermediate products are close to the viable mRNA manifold. Across three real
mRNA datasets, RNAGenScape improves the target properties with high success
rates and efficiency, outperforming various generative or optimization methods
developed for proteins or non-biological data. By providing continuous,
data-aligned trajectories that reveal how edits influence function, RNAGenScape
establishes a scalable paradigm for controllable mRNA design and latent space
exploration in mRNA sequence modeling.
