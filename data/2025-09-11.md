Motivation: 蛋白质语言模型（PLMs）虽然在蛋白质设计中表现出色，但在精确控制输出功能或属性方面存在挑战。本研究旨在探索如何利用激活导向技术（最初用于控制大型语言模型生成文本）来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种简单有效的方法：通过激活编辑引导PLM输出，并结合新的编辑位点识别模块进行蛋白质优化。实验在溶菌酶类似序列生成和优化中验证了方法的有效性。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能够无缝集成到自编码和自回归PLMs中，无需额外训练，即可生成具有目标功能的蛋白质序列。

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs), pre-trained on extensive evolutionary data
from natural proteins, have emerged as indispensable tools for protein design.
While powerful, PLMs often struggle to produce proteins with precisely
specified functionalities or properties due to inherent challenges in
controlling their outputs. In this work, we investigate the potential of
Activation Steering, a technique originally developed for controlling text
generation in Large Language Models (LLMs), to direct PLMs toward generating
protein sequences with targeted properties. We propose a simple yet effective
method that employs activation editing to steer PLM outputs, and extend this
approach to protein optimization through a novel editing site identification
module. Through comprehensive experiments on lysozyme-like sequence generation
and optimization, we demonstrate that our methods can be seamlessly integrated
into both auto-encoding and autoregressive PLMs without requiring additional
training. These results highlight a promising direction for precise protein
engineering using foundation models.

TL;DR: Igloo是一种多模态抗体循环标记器，通过对比学习将具有相似骨架二面角的循环映射到潜在空间中的临近位置，解决了传统方法覆盖范围有限的问题，并提升了抗体-抗原结合亲和力预测和循环设计的性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对互补决定区（CDR）结构的分类覆盖有限，且难以整合到蛋白质基础模型中，因此需要一种新的标记器来编码多元抗体循环信息。

Method: Igloo通过对比学习目标训练，结合骨架二面角和序列信息，生成循环标记，并可集成到蛋白质语言模型（如IglooLM和IglooALM）中。

Result: Igloo在识别相似H3环结构上优于现有方法5.9%，IglooLM在8/10的抗体-抗原目标中预测结合亲和力优于基础模型，且性能接近参数多7倍的模型。IglooALM生成的循环序列多样且结构一致。

Conclusion: Igloo证明了为抗体循环引入多模态标记的优势，扩展了抗体循环的多样性编码，提升了蛋白质基础模型和抗体CDR设计的性能。

Abstract: The complementarity-determining regions of antibodies are loop structures
that are key to their interactions with antigens, and of high importance to the
design of novel biologics. Since the 1980s, categorizing the diversity of CDR
structures into canonical clusters has enabled the identification of key
structural motifs of antibodies. However, existing approaches have limited
coverage and cannot be readily incorporated into protein foundation models.
Here we introduce ImmunoGlobulin LOOp Tokenizer, Igloo, a multimodal antibody
loop tokenizer that encodes backbone dihedral angles and sequence. Igloo is
trained using a contrastive learning objective to map loops with similar
backbone dihedral angles closer together in latent space. Igloo can efficiently
retrieve the closest matching loop structures from a structural antibody
database, outperforming existing methods on identifying similar H3 loops by
5.9\%. Igloo assigns tokens to all loops, addressing the limited coverage issue
of canonical clusters, while retaining the ability to recover canonical loop
conformations. To demonstrate the versatility of Igloo tokens, we show that
they can be incorporated into protein language models with IglooLM and
IglooALM. On predicting binding affinity of heavy chain variants, IglooLM
outperforms the base protein language model on 8 out of 10 antibody-antigen
targets. Additionally, it is on par with existing state-of-the-art
sequence-based and multimodal protein language models, performing comparably to
models with $7\times$ more parameters. IglooALM samples antibody loops which
are diverse in sequence and more consistent in structure than state-of-the-art
antibody inverse folding models. Igloo demonstrates the benefit of introducing
multimodal tokens for antibody loops for encoding the diverse landscape of
antibody loops, improving protein foundation models, and for antibody CDR
design.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Water/glycerol mixtures are common for experiments with biomacromolecules at
cryogenic temperatures due to their vitrification properties. Above the glass
transition temperature, they undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. Using the
novel EPR technique called intermolecular hyperfine Relaxation-Induced Dipolar
Modulation Enhancement (ih-RIDME), we quantified the molar composition in
frozen water/glycerol mixtures with one or the other component deuterated after
the phase transition. Our experiments reveal nearly equal phase composition
regardless of the proton/deuterium isotope balance. With the new ih-RIDME data,
we can also revisit the already reported body of glass transition data for such
mixtures and build a consistent picture for water/glycerol freezing and phase
transitions. Our results also indicate that ih-RIDME has the potential for
investigating the solvation shells of spin-labelled macromolecules.
