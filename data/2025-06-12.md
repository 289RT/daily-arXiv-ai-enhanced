Abstract: Intervertebral discs are avascular and maintain immune privilege. However,
during intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), this barrier is disrupted,
leading to extensive immune cell infiltration and localized inflammation. In
degenerated discs, macrophages, T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and granulocytic
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) are key players, exhibiting
functional heterogeneity. Dysregulated activation of inflammatory pathways,
including nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)
inflammasome activation, drives local pro-inflammatory responses, leading to
cell apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Innovative
immunotherapies, including exosome-based treatments, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene
editing, and chemokine-loaded hydrogel systems, have shown promise in reshaping
the immunological niche of intervertebral discs. These strategies can modulate
dysregulated immune responses and create a supportive environment for tissue
regeneration. However, current studies have not fully elucidated the mechanisms
of inflammatory memory and the immunometabolic axis, and they face challenges
in balancing tissue regeneration with immune homeostasis. Future studies should
employ interdisciplinary approaches such as single-cell and spatial
transcriptomics to map a comprehensive immune atlas of IDD, elucidate
intercellular crosstalk and signaling networks, and develop integrated
therapies combining targeted immunomodulation with regenerative engineering,
thereby facilitating the clinical translation of effective IDD treatments.

### [2] [Surface Induced Frustration of Inherent Dipolar Order in Nanoconfined Water](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09809)

Main category: cond-mat.soft

TL;DR: 表面效应可以显著改变液体的自然有序性，尤其是在纳米尺度下，例如纳米约束水。这种效应可能通过表面相互作用向内传播，并与来自相对表面的效应相互干扰。研究探讨了这种溶剂介导的相互作用对纳米约束液体（包括水和蛋白质表面）介电常数的影响。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究表面如何通过取向重排和改变水分子间的横相关来影响纳米约束液体（如水）和蛋白质表面的介电性质。

Method: 通过分子动力学模拟和统计分析，研究纳米狭缝孔隙、纳米管/圆柱和纳米球的约束环境，以及具有不同结构特征的蛋白质水化层。

Result: 研究发现蛋白质水化层中存在有趣的取向排列，产生了长程分子横相关。研究还表明，水分子间的横相关长度尺度受约束环境显著影响。

Conclusion: 表面效应对纳米约束液体和生物分子的介电性质具有重要影响，尤其是在水或蛋白质表面的约束环境中，这种效应可以通过取向和横相关传播到较长距离。

Abstract: Surface effects could play a dominant role in modifying the natural liquid
order. In some cases, the effects of the surface interactions can propagate
inwards, and even can interfere with a similar propagation from opposite
surfaces. This can be particularly evident in liquid water under
nano-confinement. The large dipolar cross-correlations among distinct molecules
that give rise to the unusually large dielectric constant of water (and in turn
owe their origin to the extended hydrogen bond (HB) network) can get perturbed
by surfaces. The perturbation can propagate inwards and then interfere with the
one from the opposite surface if confinement is only a few layers wide. This
can give rise to short-to-intermediate range solvent-mediated interaction
between two surfaces. Here we study the effects of such interactions on the
dielectric constant of nano-confined liquids, not just water but also ordering
at protein surfaces. The surfaces work at two levels: (i) induce orientational
realignment, and (ii) alter the cross-correlations between water molecules.
Molecular dynamics simulations and statistical analyses are used to address
these aspects in confinement of slit pores, nano tube/cylinder, and nano
sphere. In addition, we consider the hydration layers of multiple proteins with
vastly different structural features. These studies give us a measure of the
extent or the length scale of cross-correlations between dipole moments of
water molecules. We find an interesting orientational arrangement in the
protein hydration layers, giving rise to long-range molecular
cross-correlations. To decouple the effect of HB from the effect of geometry,
we additionally study acetonitrile under nanoconfinement. Importantly, while a
protein's interior is characterized by a small dielectric constant, the dipole
moment of a peptide bond is large, and thus susceptible to fluctuations in
water.

### [3] [Discrete-space and -time analogue of a super-diffusive fractional Brownian motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09921)
*Enzo Marinari,Gleb Oshanin*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: 论文讨论了如何构造一个可靠且具有整数时间和格点版本的超级扩散分数布朗运动（fBm），并提出了两种算法验证其在数值模拟中的有效性，同时揭示了超级扩散与亚扩散fBm的显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究超级扩散fBm的格点和整数时间版本，以解决实际实验中非马尔可夫高斯随机过程的建模问题，并探索其与亚扩散fBm的本质区别。

Method: 提出两种算法，通过数值模拟验证格点随机行走与标准fBm的协方差函数和轨迹一致性。

Result: 算法成功复现了超级扩散fBm的特性，并揭示了其与亚扩散fBm的本质差异。

Conclusion: 超级扩散fBm的格点和整数时间版本可可靠构造，但其亚扩散版本的构造仍是一个开放性问题；两种fBm本质上有显著不同。

Abstract: We discuss how to construct reliably well "a lattice and an integer time"
version of a super-diffusive continuous-space and -time fractional Brownian
motion (fBm) -- an experimentally-relevant non-Markovian Gaussian stochastic
process with an everlasting power-law memory on the time-evolution of thermal
noises extending over the entire past. We propose two algorithms, which are
both validated by extensive numerical simulations showing that the ensuing
lattice random walks have not only the same power-law covariance function as
the standard fBm, but also individual trajectories follow those of the
super-diffusive fBm. Finding a lattice and an integer time analogue of a
sub-diffusion fBm, which is an anti-persistent process, remains a challenging
open problem. Our results also clarify the relevant difference between
sub-diffusive and super-diffusive fBm, that are frequently seen as two very
analogous realizations of processes with memory. They are indeed substantially
different.
