Abstract: The TIM-barrel fold is one of the most versatile and ubiquitous protein folds
in nature, hosting a wide variety of catalytic activities and functions while
serving as a model system in protein biochemistry and engineering. This review
explores its role as a key fold model in protein design, particularly in
addressing challenges in stabilization and functionalization. We discuss
historical and recent advances in de novo TIM barrel design from the landmark
creation of sTIM11 to the development of the diversified variants, with a
special focus on deepening our understanding of the determinants that modulate
the sequence-structure-function relationships of this architecture. Also, we
examine why the diversification of de novo TIM barrels towards
functionalization remains a major challenge, given the absence of natural-like
active site features. Current approaches have focused on incorporating
structural extensions, modifying loops, and using cutting-edge AI-based
strategies to create scaffolds with tailored characteristics. Despite
significant advances, achieving enzymatically active de novo TIM barrels has
been proven difficult, with only recent breakthroughs demonstrating
functionalized designs. We discuss the limitations of stepwise
functionalization approaches and support an integrated approach that
simultaneously optimizes scaffold structure and active site shape, using both
physical- and AI-driven methods. By combining computational and experimental
insights, we highlight the TIM barrel as a powerful template for custom enzyme
design and as a model system to explore the intersection of protein
biochemistry, biophysics, and design.
