A mathematical model that implements a chromonic\nliquid-crystalline phase and that captures the changes in topology has been\nlacking. We adopt a mathematical model that represents the viral DNA as a pair\nof a vector field and a line. The vector field is a minimizer of the total\nOseen-Frank energy for nematic liquid crystals under chromonic constraints,\nwhile the line is identified with the tangent to the field at selected\nlocations, representing the central axis of the DNA molecule. The fact that the\nOseen-Frank functional assigns infinite energy to topological defects (point\ndefects in two dimensions and line defects in three dimensions) precludes the\npresence of singularities and, in particular, of knot structures. To address\nthis issue, we begin with the optimal vector field and helical line, and\npropose a new algorithm to introduce knots through stochastic perturbations\nassociated with splay and twist deformations, modeled by means of a Langevin\nsystem. We conclude by comparing knot distributions generated by the model and\nby interpreting them in the context of previously published experimental\nresults. Altogether, this work relies on the synergy of modeling, analysis and\ncomputation in the study of viral DNA organization in capsids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u566c\u83cc\u4f53DNA\u5728\u75c5\u6bd2\u8863\u58f3\u4e2d\u7684\u6392\u5217\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6db2\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u548c\u7ebf\u6761\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u751f\u6210DNA\u7684\u7ed3\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u566c\u83cc\u4f53DNA\u5728\u8863\u58f3\u4e2d\u7684\u6392\u5217\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u548c\u7ebf\u6761\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Oseen-Frank\u80fd\u91cf\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\u6a21\u62dfDNA\u7ed3\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u75c5\u6bd2DNA\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
