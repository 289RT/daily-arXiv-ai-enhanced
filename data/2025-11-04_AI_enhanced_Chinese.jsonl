This review provides a systematic\ncomparison of their application in designing two principal therapeutic\nmodalities: small molecules and therapeutic peptides. We analyze how a unified\nframework of iterative denoising is adapted to the distinct molecular\nrepresentations, chemical spaces, and design objectives of each modality. For\nsmall molecules, these models excel at structure-based design, generating\nnovel, pocket-fitting ligands with desired physicochemical properties, yet face\nthe critical hurdle of ensuring chemical synthesizability. Conversely, for\ntherapeutic peptides, the focus shifts to generating functional sequences and\ndesigning de novo structures, where the primary challenges are achieving\nbiological stability against proteolysis, ensuring proper folding, and\nminimizing immunogenicity. Despite these distinct challenges, both domains face\nshared hurdles: the need for more accurate scoring functions, the scarcity of\nhigh-quality experimental data, and the crucial requirement for experimental\nvalidation. We conclude that the full potential of diffusion models will be\nunlocked by bridging these modality-specific gaps and integrating them into\nautomated, closed-loop Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) platforms, thereby\nshifting the paradigm from chemical exploration to the targeted creation of\nnovel therapeutics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u80bd\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u81ea\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u53d8\u9769\u4f20\u7edf\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u6cbb\u7597\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u80bd\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u80bd\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5404\u81ea\u9762\u4e34\u5316\u5b66\u5408\u6210\u6027\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5b9a\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230DBTL\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u91ca\u653e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8f6c\u5411\u9776\u5411\u65b0\u7597\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}
