*Anas Aziz Khan,Md Shah Fahad,Priyanka,Ramesh Chandra,Guransh Singh*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: EnzyCLIP是一个新颖的双编码器框架，通过对比学习和交叉注意力机制从蛋白质序列和底物分子结构中预测酶动力学参数（Kcat和Km），表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测酶动力学参数对药物发现和合成生物学至关重要，但现有方法难以捕捉复杂的酶-底物相互作用，且常忽略Kcat和Km的联合预测。

Method: EnzyCLIP结合了ESM-2蛋白质语言模型和ChemBERTa化学表示，通过CLIP架构和双向交叉注意力机制进行动态建模，并联合对比损失和回归损失。

Result: 在CatPred-DB数据库上，EnzyCLIP的Kcat和Km预测R2分数分别为0.593和0.607；XGBoost进一步提升了Km预测（R2=0.61）。

Conclusion: EnzyCLIP为酶动力学参数预测提供了高效的多模态联合建模方法，在药物和生物工程领域有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of enzyme kinetic parameters is crucial for drug discovery, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology applications. Current computational approaches face limitations in capturing complex enzyme-substrate interactions and often focus on single parameters while neglecting the joint prediction of catalytic turnover numbers (Kcat) and Michaelis-Menten constants (Km). We present EnzyCLIP, a novel dual-encoder framework that leverages contrastive learning and cross-attention mechanisms to predict enzyme kinetic parameters from protein sequences and substrate molecular structures. Our approach integrates ESM-2 protein language model embeddings with ChemBERTa chemical representations through a CLIP-inspired architecture enhanced with bidirectional cross-attention for dynamic enzyme-substrate interaction modeling. EnzyCLIP combines InfoNCE contrastive loss with Huber regression loss to learn aligned multimodal representations while predicting log10-transformed kinetic parameters. The model is trained on the CatPred-DB database containing 23,151 Kcat and 41,174 Km experimentally validated measurements, and achieved competitive performance with R2 scores of 0.593 for Kcat and 0.607 for Km prediction. XGBoost ensemble methods applied to the learned embeddings further improved Km prediction (R2 = 0.61) while maintaining robust Kcat performance.

### [2] [DeepFRI Demystified: Interpretability vs. Accuracy in AI Protein Function Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00642)
*Ananya Krishna,Valentina Simon,Arjan Kohli*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: DeepFRI模型的预测结果更倾向于保守基序而非关键残基，解释方法在精细度上差异显著，需要改进以提高可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证蛋白质功能预测模型的可靠性，促进药物开发和监管。

Method: 使用GradCAM、Excitation Backpropagation和PGExplainer等解释技术及对抗鲁棒性测试评估DeepFRI。

Result: DeepFRI优先考虑保守基序，解释方法精细度不同，GradCAM提供广泛相关性，PGExplainer定位特定活性位点。

Conclusion: 需在DeepFRI架构中改进准确性、可解释性及可信度。

Abstract: Machine learning technologies for protein function prediction are black box models. Despite their potential to identify key drug targets with high accuracy and accelerate therapy development, the adoption of these methods depends on verifying their findings. This study evaluates DeepFRI, a leading Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based tool, using advanced explainability techniques (GradCAM, Excitation Backpropagation, and PGExplainer) and adversarial robustness tests. Our findings reveal that the model's predictions often prioritize conserved motifs over truly deterministic residues, complicating the identification of functional sites. Quantitative analyses show that explainability methods differ significantly in granularity, with GradCAM providing broad relevance and PGExplainer pinpointing specific active sites. These results highlight tradeoffs between accuracy and interpretability, suggesting areas for improvement in DeepFRI's architecture to enhance its trustworthiness in drug discovery and regulatory settings.

Abstract: Wearable electronics hold great potential in defining new paradigms of modern healthcare, including personalized health management, precision medicine, and athletic performance optimization. This stems from their ability in enabling continuous, real-time health monitoring. To enable molecular-level analysis, biofluids rich in molecular analytes have become one of the most important target samples for wearable sensors. Among them, sweat stands out as an ideal candidate for next-generation wearable health monitoring platforms due to its completely noninvasive nature and ease of acquisition. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated feasible prototype designs for sweat-based wearable sensors. However, one of the major gaps toward large-scale commercialization is the development of clinically validated standards for sweat analysis. One key requirement is to establish the relationship between sweat analytes and those of blood, the latter serving as the gold standard in modern diagnostics. This review provides an overview of sweat biomarkers, with a particular focus on their partitioning mechanisms, which reveal the underlying connections between sweat analytes and their counterparts within systemic metabolic pathways. In addition, this review offers a mechanistic-level examination of biosensors employed in sweat sensing, addressing a gap that has not been adequately covered in prior reviews. Given the critical role of electronic systems in constructing highly integrated wearable sweat-monitoring platforms, this review also analyzes the electronic architectures used for sensor signal processing from an interdisciplinary perspective, with particular emphasis on the analog circuitry that interfaces with electrochemical sensors.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: SIDE是一种新的计算框架，用于模拟大分子系统的构象转变，结合了Langevin桥公式和粗粒化势能，生成平滑、低能量的轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大分子系统构象转变的现实路径生成问题，旨在提供一种高效且物理意义明确的计算方法。

Method: 基于Langevin桥公式的随机积分微分框架，结合Go-like项和Rouse型弹性势能的粗粒化势能方法。

Result: SIDE生成的轨迹平滑、能量低，能保持分子几何结构并捕捉实验支持的中间态，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SIDE是一种强大且高效的大分子构象转变建模策略，尽管对复杂运动的处理仍有改进空间。

Abstract: We introduce a computational framework for generating realistic transition paths between distinct conformations of large bio-molecular systems. The method is built on a stochastic integro-differential formulation derived from the Langevin bridge formalism, which constrains molecular trajectories to reach a prescribed final state within a finite time and yields an efficient low-temperature approximation of the exact bridge equation. To obtain physically meaningful protein transitions, we couple this formulation to a new coarse-grained potential combining a Go-like term that preserves native backbone geometry with a Rouse-type elastic energy term from polymer physics; we refer to the resulting approach as SIDE. We evaluate SIDE on several proteins undergoing large-scale conformational changes and compare its performance with established methods such as MinActionPath and EBDIMS. SIDE generates smooth, low-energy trajectories that maintain molecular geometry and frequently recover experimentally supported intermediate states. Although challenges remain for highly complex motions-largely due to the simplified coarse-grained potential-our results demonstrate that SIDE offers a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for modeling bio-molecular conformational transitions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过高质量序列-结构对齐数据提升蛋白质设计模型性能的方法，并展示了其在两个模型上的显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的合成数据集常包含不良的序列-结构对，影响生成模型的性能，因此需要高质量的训练数据集。

Method: 利用ProteinMPNN和结构预测模型对齐高质量的合成结构与可恢复的合成序列，创建新数据集，并用于训练La-Proteina和Proteina Atomistica。

Result: 在La-Proteina上，结构多样性提升54%，协同设计能力提升27%；在Proteina Atomistica上，结构多样性提升73%，协同设计能力提升5%。

Conclusion: 序列-结构数据的对齐对高性能蛋白质设计模型的训练至关重要，新数据集将公开。

Abstract: High-quality training datasets are crucial for the development of effective protein design models, but existing synthetic datasets often include unfavorable sequence-structure pairs, impairing generative model performance. We leverage ProteinMPNN, whose sequences are experimentally favorable as well as amenable to folding, together with structure prediction models to align high-quality synthetic structures with recoverable synthetic sequences. In that way, we create a new dataset designed specifically for training expressive, fully atomistic protein generators. By retraining La-Proteina, which models discrete residue type and side chain structure in a continuous latent space, on this dataset, we achieve new state-of-the-art results, with improvements of +54% in structural diversity and +27% in co-designability. To validate the broad utility of our approach, we further introduce Proteina Atomistica, a unified flow-based framework that jointly learns the distribution of protein backbone structure, discrete sequences, and atomistic side chains without latent variables. We again find that training on our new sequence-structure data dramatically boosts benchmark performance, improving \method's structural diversity by +73% and co-designability by +5%. Our work highlights the critical importance of aligned sequence-structure data for training high-performance de novo protein design models. All data will be publicly released.

*Shitong Luo,Connor W. Coley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrexSyn是一种基于解码器Transformer的高效分子发现模型，能够在可合成化学空间中生成满足单属性或多属性条件的分子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成化学空间的受限性使得生成既具有理想性质又易于合成的分子成为挑战。PrexSyn旨在解决这一问题。

Result: PrexSyn能够高精度覆盖可合成化学空间，并高效优化分子以满足复合属性查询。

Conclusion: PrexSyn在可合成化学空间覆盖率、分子采样效率和推理速度方面达到了新水平。

Abstract: The constrained nature of synthesizable chemical space poses a significant challenge for sampling molecules that are both synthetically accessible and possess desired properties. In this work, we present PrexSyn, an efficient and programmable model for molecular discovery within synthesizable chemical space. PrexSyn is based on a decoder-only transformer trained on a billion-scale datastream of synthesizable pathways paired with molecular properties, enabled by a real-time, high-throughput C++-based data generation engine. The large-scale training data allows PrexSyn to reconstruct the synthesizable chemical space nearly perfectly at a high inference speed and learn the association between properties and synthesizable molecules. Based on its learned property-pathway mappings, PrexSyn can generate synthesizable molecules that satisfy not only single-property conditions but also composite property queries joined by logical operators, thereby allowing users to ``program'' generation objectives. Moreover, by exploiting this property-based querying capability, PrexSyn can efficiently optimize molecules against black-box oracle functions via iterative query refinement, achieving higher sampling efficiency than even synthesis-agnostic baselines, making PrexSyn a powerful general-purpose molecular optimization tool. Overall, PrexSyn pushes the frontier of synthesizable molecular design by setting a new state of the art in synthesizable chemical space coverage, molecular sampling efficiency, and inference speed.

Abstract: Advancements in AI for science unlocks capabilities for critical drug discovery tasks such as protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. However, current models overfit to existing oversimplified datasets that does not represent naturally occurring and biologically relevant proteins with modifications. In this work, we curate a complete and modification-aware version of the widely used DAVIS dataset by incorporating 4,032 kinase-ligand pairs involving substitutions, insertions, deletions, and phosphorylation events. This enriched dataset enables benchmarking of predictive models under biologically realistic conditions. Based on this new dataset, we propose three benchmark settings-Augmented Dataset Prediction, Wild-Type to Modification Generalization, and Few-Shot Modification Generalization-designed to assess model robustness in the presence of protein modifications. Through extensive evaluation of both docking-free and docking-based methods, we find that docking-based model generalize better in zero-shot settings. In contrast, docking-free models tend to overfit to wild-type proteins and struggle with unseen modifications but show notable improvement when fine-tuned on a small set of modified examples. We anticipate that the curated dataset and benchmarks offer a valuable foundation for developing models that better generalize to protein modifications, ultimately advancing precision medicine in drug discovery.

Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) sustain mechanical stresses associated with microcirculatory flow through ATP-driven plasma membrane flickering. This is an active phenomenon driven by motor proteins that regulate interactions between the spectrin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer; it is manifested in RBC shape fluctuations reflecting the cell's mechanical and metabolic state. Yet, direct quantification of the forces and energetic costs underlying this non-equilibrium behavior remains challenging due to the invasiveness of existing techniques. Here, a minimally invasive method that combines bead-free, low-power optical tweezers with high-speed video microscopy was employed to track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs during the same time window. This independent dual-channel measurement enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different chemical treatments, that allowed for differentiating between metabolic and structural states based on their fluctuation-force signatures. Quantification of mechanical work during flickering demonstrated that membrane softening enhanced fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, enabling precise probing of cellular physiology and detection of biomechanical dysfunction in diseases.
