However, current benchmarks inadequately\nassess model performance in biologically challenging contexts, especially those\ninvolving intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), limiting their utility in\napplications such as drug discovery, disease variant interpretation, and\nprotein interface design. We introduce DisProtBench, a comprehensive benchmark\nfor evaluating protein structure prediction models (PSPMs) under structural\ndisorder and complex biological conditions. DisProtBench spans three key axes:\n(1) Data complexity, covering disordered regions, G protein-coupled receptor\n(GPCR) ligand pairs, and multimeric complexes; (2) Task diversity, benchmarking\ntwelve leading PSPMs across structure-based tasks with unified classification,\nregression, and interface metrics; and (3) Interpretability, via the\nDisProtBench Portal, which provides precomputed 3D structures and visual error\nanalyses. Our results reveal significant variability in model robustness under\ndisorder, with low-confidence regions linked to functional prediction failures.\nNotably, global accuracy metrics often fail to predict task performance in\ndisordered settings, emphasizing the need for function-aware evaluation.\nDisProtBench establishes a reproducible, extensible, and biologically grounded\nframework for assessing next-generation PSPMs in realistic biomedical\nscenarios."}

Although their main established function lacks\ndirect evidence in human olfaction, OBPs are traditionally believed to act as\nodorant transporters in the olfactory sense, which led to the exploration of\nOBPs as biomimetic sensor units in artificial noses. Now, available RNA-seq and\nproteomics data identified the expression of human OBPs (hOBP2A and hOBP2B) in\nboth, male and female reproductive tissues. This observation prompted the\nconjecture that OBPs may possess functions that go beyond the olfactory sense,\npotentially as hormone transporters. Such a function could further link them to\nthe tumorigenesis and cancer progression of hormone dependent cancer types\nincluding ovarian, breast, prostate and uterine cancer. In this structured\nreview, we use available data to explore the effects of genetic alterations\nsuch as somatic copy number aberrations and single nucleotide variants on OBP\nfunction and their corresponding gene expression profiles. Our computational\nanalyses suggest that somatic copy number aberrations in OBPs are associated\nwith large changes in gene expression in reproductive cancers while point\nmutations have little to no effect. Additionally, the structural\ncharacteristics of OBPs, together with other lipocalin family members, allow us\nto explore putative functions within the context of cancer biology. Our\noverview consolidates current knowledge on putative human OBP functions, their\nexpression patterns, and structural features. Finally, it provides an overview\non applications, highlighting emerging hypotheses and future research\ndirections within olfactory and non-olfactory roles."}

However, the\nheterogeneous nature of EVs necessitates advanced methods for profiling EVs at\nthe single-particle level. While nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) is a\nwidely used technique for quantifying particle size and concentration,\nconventional scattering-based systems are non-specific. In this study, we\npresent an optimised protocol for quantitative profiling of EVs at the\nsingle-particle level by fluorescent NTA (F-NTA). The protocol integrates\nfluorescent immunolabeling of EVs with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to\nefficiently remove unbound labels, enabling the precise quantification of EV\nconcentration, size distribution, and surface immunophenotype. We first\nvalidated this approach using biotinylated liposomes and EVs from cultured\nhuman cell lines, confirming effective removal of unbound labels and assessing\nlabelling efficiency. We then demonstrated that F-NTA can distinguish EV\nsubpopulations with distinct surface marker expression, exemplified by the\ndifferentiation of EpCAM-positive EVs derived from HT29 and HEK293 cells.\nFinally, we applied dual labelling to human plasma isolates to simultaneously\nprofile EVs and non-vesicular extracellular particles, providing a quantitative\nquality assessment of EV purity at the single-particle level. The robustness of\nthis method was further supported by comparative analysis with total internal\nreflection fluorescence microscopy. This validated workflow enables robust,\nquantitative profiling of EV subpopulations, providing a critical tool for\ndiverse EV applications, including biomarker discovery, therapeutic monitoring,\nand quality control for engineered vesicles."}

By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the\nframework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question\nanswering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular\nrefinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study\ntargeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved\nrelevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES\nrepresentations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with\nimproved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically\ndiverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided\niterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of\nmolecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least\nfour out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a\npool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D\nprotein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for\ncandidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively\nsupports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its\nmodular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,\nproviding a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery."}

While transformer-based models such as TULIP have\nachieved impressive performance in this domain, their black-box nature\nprecludes interpretability and thus limits a deeper mechanistic understanding\nof T cell response. Most existing post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods are\nconfined to encoder-only, co-attention, or model-specific architectures and\ncannot handle encoder-decoder transformers used in TCR-pMHC modeling. To\naddress this gap, we propose Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction (QCAI), a\nnew post-hoc method designed to interpret the cross-attention mechanisms in\ntransformer decoders. Quantitative evaluation is a challenge for XAI methods;\nwe have compiled TCR-XAI, a benchmark consisting of 274 experimentally\ndetermined TCR-pMHC structures to serve as ground truth for binding. Using\nthese structures we compute physical distances between relevant amino acid\nresidues in the TCR-pMHC interaction region and evaluate how well our method\nand others estimate the importance of residues in this region across the\ndataset.

However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular\nrepresentation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler\nCharacteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor.\nComputed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic\nfeatures, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features,\noffering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature\nspace. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine\nbenchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition\nconstant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation\nagainst traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular\nfingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show\nthat our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking\namong the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its\ncombination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON\nfingerprint, significantly \\emph{enhances predictive performance},\noutperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the\ncomplementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for\nbeing combined with established techniques.

However, existing benchmarks\npredominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's\ncapability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is\ncrucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction\nprediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,\nmulti-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818\ninteractions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and\nleakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two\ncomplementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess\nintra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented\ntasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and\nessential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's\ncapability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein\nfunction annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism\nanalysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,\nconsisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language\nmodel-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI\nmodels have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional\nproperties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world\nbiological applications.
