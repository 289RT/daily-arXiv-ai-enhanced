We developed and produced the\nchimera protein by linking AFPIII, an ice-binding protein, with CBM3a, a\nCNC-binding protein. As the suspension freezes, the CNC chains self-organize\ninto a reinforcing network between the ice crystals. This structural\nenhancement limits crack propagation to typical pore sizes, allowing BioPykrete\nto avoid the brittle and sudden failure commonly associated with ice. Instead,\nit exhibits an elastic-like response to stress, making it suitable for\nconstruction and engineering applications. With compressive strength comparable\nwith concrete, BioPykrete offers a sustainable and biodegradable alternative to\nconstruction materials suitable for the harsh arctic regions of the world where\ntraditional methods are ineffective, and resources are scarce. Engineering\nchimera proteins with specific affinity to more than a single material type may\nhelp improve or tailor the properties of other composite materials."}
