Motivation: 单组学数据难以准确预测癌症细胞对靶向治疗的反应，因此需要整合多组学数据以提高预测精度。

Method: 结合基因组、转录组、蛋白质组、表观基因组和代谢组数据，使用GCN处理蛋白网络信息，并通过注意力机制动态融合不同组学模态。

Result: 蛋白质组和转录组数据的整合表现最佳（R2约0.96），优于单组学和全模态整合。

Conclusion: 该方法为精准肿瘤学和靶向治疗的预测建模提供了有前景的计算框架。

Abstract: Cancer cell response to targeted therapy arises from complex molecular interactions, making single omics insufficient for accurate prediction. This study develops a model to predict Dabrafenib sensitivity by integrating multiple omics layers (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics) with protein network embeddings generated using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Each modality is encoded into low dimensional representations through neural network preprocessing. Protein interaction information from STRING is incorporated using GCN to capture biological topology. An attention based fusion mechanism assigns adaptive weights to each modality according to its relevance. Using GDSC cancer cell line data, the model shows that selective integration of two modalities, especially proteomics and transcriptomics, achieves the best test performance (R2 around 0.96), outperforming all single omics and full multimodal settings. Genomic and epigenomic data were less informative, while proteomic and transcriptomic layers provided stronger phenotypic signals related to MAPK inhibitor activity. These results show that attention guided multi omics fusion combined with GCN improves drug response prediction and reveals complementary molecular determinants of Dabrafenib sensitivity. The approach offers a promising computational framework for precision oncology and predictive modeling of targeted therapies.
