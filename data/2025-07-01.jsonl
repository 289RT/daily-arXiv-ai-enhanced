Davis"], "title": "Resolving structural dynamics in situ through cryogenic electron tomography", "categories": ["q-bio.BM"], "comment": null, "summary": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful tool for\nstudying the structural heterogeneity of proteins and their complexes, offering\ninsights into macromolecular dynamics directly within cells. Driven by recent\ncomputational advances, including powerful machine learning frameworks,\nresearchers can now resolve both discrete structural states and continuous\nconformational changes from 3D subtomograms and stacks of 2D particle-images\nacquired across tilt-series. In this review, we survey recent innovations in\nparticle classification and heterogeneous 3D reconstruction methods, focusing\nspecifically on the relative merits of workflows that operate on reconstructed\n3D subtomogram volumes compared to those using extracted 2D particle-images. We\nadditionally highlight how these methods have provided specific biological\ninsights into the organization, dynamics, and structural variability of\ncellular components. Finally, we advocate for the development of benchmarking\ndatasets collected in vitro and in situ to enable a more objective comparison\nof existent and emerging methods for particle classification and heterogeneous\n3D reconstruction."}

Matta"], "title": "Rotational Dynamics of ATP Synthase: Mechanical Constraints and Energy Dissipative Channels", "categories": ["q-bio.BM"], "comment": "20 pages, 2 figures, 13 equations, 103 references", "summary": "The proton motive force (PMF) across the inner mitochondrial membrane\ndelivers approximately 0.2 eV of energy per proton, powering the FoF1-ATP\nsynthase molecular motor. Here, we provide a detailed accounting of how this\nenergy is utilized: Approximately 75-83% is transduced into the chemical free\nenergy of ATP synthesis, while the remaining 17-25% is dissipated through\ninternal friction, viscous drag, proton leakage, electroviscous effects,\nelastic deformations, and information-theoretic costs. Each dissipation channel\nis quantitatively evaluated, revealing that internal friction in the F1 motor\nis the dominant loss mechanism. In this work, we did not account for the energy\nsupplied/injected due to the intrinsic electrostatic potential of the enzyme\nitself. In addition to this energy bookkeeping, we also examine the quantum\nmechanical constraints on the Fo unit's rotation. We find that, as can be\nexpected, the energy spacing between quantized rotational states is several\norders of magnitude smaller than thermal energies at physiological temperature,\nand that the tunneling probability through rotational barriers practically\ntotally non-existent. Furthermore, the biological rotation speed (100-650\nrevolutions per second (rps)) is between one and three orders of magnitude\nbelow the quantum limit implied by quantization of angular momentum of the\nc-ring (which would have been ca. 13,000 to 62,000 rps (depending on the size\nof the c-ring (17 to 8 subunits, respectively)) in the first rotational energy\nlevel of the c-ring). Nevertheless, experimental estimates of the rotation\nrates in isolated c-ring suggest rates in the vicinity of 43,000 rps, right\nwithin our theoretical quantum estimates. However, ATP synthase as a whole\noperates firmly within the classical regime, despite its nanoscale dimensions,\nand highlight its evolutionary optimization for robust and efficient energy\nconversion...."}
