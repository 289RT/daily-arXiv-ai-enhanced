Abstract: By stabilizing weak and transient protein-protein interactions (PPIs),
molecular glues address the challenge of targeting proteins previously
considered undruggable. Rapamycin and WDB002 are molecular glues that bind to
FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and target the FKBP12-rapamycin-associated
protein (FRAP) and the centrosomal protein 250 (CEP250), respectively. Here, we
used molecular dynamics simulations to gain insights into the effects of
molecular glues on protein conformation and PPIs. The molecular glues modulated
protein flexibility, leading to less flexibility in some regions, and changed
the pattern and stability of water-mediated hydrogen bonds between the
proteins. Our findings highlight the importance of considering water-mediated
hydrogen bonds in developing strategies for the rational design of molecular
glues.

Abstract: How proteins fold remains a central unsolved problem in biology. While the
idea of a folding code embedded in the amino acid sequence was introduced more
than 6 decades ago, this code remains undefined. While we now have powerful
predictive tools to predict the final native structure of proteins, we still
lack a predictive framework for how sequences dictate folding pathways. Two
main conceptual models dominate as explanations of folding mechanism: the
funnel model, in which folding proceeds through many alternative routes on a
rugged, hyperdimensional energy landscape; and the foldon model, which proposes
a hierarchical sequence of discrete intermediates. Recent advances on two
fronts are now enabling folding studies in unprecedented ways. Powerful
experimental approaches; in particular, single-molecule force spectroscopy and
hydrogen (deuterium exchange assays) allow time-resolved tracking of the
folding process at high resolution. At the same time, computational
breakthroughs culminating in algorithms such as AlphaFold have revolutionized
static structure prediction, opening opportunities to extend machine learning
toward dynamics. Together, these developments mark a turning point: for the
first time, we are positioned to resolve how proteins fold, why they misfold,
and how this knowledge can be harnessed for biology and medicine.

Abstract: DNA helicases undergo conformational changes; however, their structural
dynamics are poorly understood. Here, we study single molecules of superfamily
1A DNA helicase Rep, which undergo conformational transitions during bacterial
DNA replication, repair and recombination. We use time-correlated single-photon
counting (TCSPC), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), rapid
single-molecule F\"orster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), Anti-Brownian
ELectrokinetic (ABEL) trapping and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) to
provide unparalleled temporal and spatial resolution of Rep's domain movements.
We detect four states revealing two hitherto hidden intermediates (S2, S3),
between the open (S1) and closed (S4) structures, whose stability is salt
dependent. Rep's open-to-closed switch involves multiple changes to all four
subdomains 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B along the S1 to S2 to S3 to S4 transitional
pathway comprising an initial truncated swing of 2B which then rolls across the
1B surface, following by combined rotations of 1B, 2A and 2B. High forward and
reverse rates for S1 to S2 suggest that 1B may act to frustrate 2B movement to
prevent premature Rep closure in the absence of DNA. These observations support
a more general binding model for accessory DNA helicases that utilises
conformational plasticity to explore a multiplicity of structures whose
landscape can be tuned by salt prior to locking-in upon DNA binding.
