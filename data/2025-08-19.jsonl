Under Review", "summary": "We introduce a pipeline for representing a protein, or protein complex, as\nthe union of signed distance functions (SDFs) by representing each atom as a\nsphere with the appropriate radius. While this idea has been used previously as\na way to render images of proteins, it has not, to our knowledge, been widely\nadopted in a machine learning setting. Mirroring recent successful work\napplying SDFs to represent 3D geometry, we present a proof of concept that this\nrepresentation of proteins could be useful in several biologically relevant\napplications. We also propose further experiments that are necessary to\nvalidate the proposed approach."}

Despite in\nsilico methods that have been proposed to predict both linear (continuous) and\nconformational (discontinuous) epitopes, they consistently underperform in\npredicting conformational epitopes. In this work, we propose a conformer-based\nmodel trained on antigen sequences derived from 1,080 antigen-antibody\ncomplexes, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local\nfeatures and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies within antigen\nsequences. Ablation studies demonstrate that CNN enhances the prediction of\nlinear epitopes, and the Transformer module improves the prediction of\nconformational epitopes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms\nexisting baselines in terms of PCC, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1 scores on\nconformational epitopes."}

Beyerle"], "title": "Applied causality to infer protein dynamics and kinetics", "categories": ["q-bio.BM", "physics.bio-ph"], "comment": "12 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "The use of generative machine learning models, trained on the experimentally\nresolved structures deposited in the protein data bank, is an attractive\napproach to sampling conformational ensembles of proteins. Unfortunately, since\nthe machine-learned model utilized to generate these ensembles is not tied to\nan equation of motion, such as a molecular dynamics integrator or other causal\ngenerator of the dynamics, there is no timescale or causal information encoded\nin them. As such, with this work, we use the structural ensembles generated\nfrom AlphaFold2 at a range of reduced MSA depths to parameterize the potential\nof mean force of an overdamped, memory-free, coarse-grained Langevin equation.\nThis approach couples the AlphaFold2 ensembles to a causal model, allowing us\nto estimate the timescales spanned by the AlphaFold2-generated ensembles at\neach MSA depth. Performing this analysis on six variants of HIV-1 protease, we\nconfirm an inverse relationship between MSA depth and the timescale of an\nensemble's conformational fluctuations, since the MSA depth essentially serves\nas a conformational restraint, and AlphaFold2 is generally able to probe\ntimescales at or below those seen in microsecond-long, unbiased molecular\ndynamics simulations. We conclude by generalizing this approach to other\nmachine-learned structure-prediction methods."}

The Schistosoma mansoni\nthioredoxin glutathione reductase (SmTGR) is essential for parasite redox\nbalance and immune evasion, making it a key therapeutic target. This study\nemploys predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling\nto identify potential SmTGR inhibitors. Using deep learning, a robust QSAR\nmodel was developed and validated, achieving high predictive accuracy. The\npredicted novel inhibitors were further validated through molecular docking\nstudies, which demonstrated strong binding affinities, with the highest docking\nscore of -10.76+-0.01kcal/mol. Visualization of the docked structures in both\n2D and 3D confirmed similar interactions for the inhibitors and commercial\ndrugs, further supporting their therapeutic effectiveness and the predictive\nability of the model. This study demonstrates the potential of QSAR modeling in\naccelerating drug discovery, offering a promising avenue for developing novel\ntherapeutics targeting SmTGR to improve schistosomiasis treatment."}

The\nsoftware provides a minimal, reproducible interface for (i) protein-ligand\nstructure ingestion and preprocessing, (ii) QUBO model construction from\ngeometric/compatibility constraints, and (iii) decoding solutions into\ncandidate poses for downstream ranking. Implemented in Python with GPU\nacceleration, QUBODock emphasizes usability and reproducibility: it is\ndistributed on PyPI and can be installed with a single command.

Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing\nmodels that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present\nFlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the\nstate of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial\nperformance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes\nto the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching\nformulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three\narchitecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost:\nself-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3\nachieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit\nhydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and\ngeometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer\nlearnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these\ntechniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative\nmodels, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during\ninference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving\nthe stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative\nmodels."}
