Strelnikov"], "title": "Cation-DNA outer sphere coordination in DNA polymorphism", "categories": ["q-bio.BM"], "comment": null, "summary": "There are two approaches to describing DNA-ions interactions. The physical\napproach is an analysis of electrostatic interactions between ions and charges\non the DNA molecule. The coordination chemistry approach is a search for modes\nof direct binding of ions to ionophores of DNA. We study both the inner and\nouter sphere coordination of ions by ionophores of the A and C forms of DNA in\nmolecular dynamics simulations in two low-polarity solvents: in ethanol-water\nand methanol-water mixtures. We show that the counterion-DNA outer sphere\ncoordination plays a key role in the experimentally observed conformational\npolymorphism of the DNA molecule: a transition to the A form in ethanol and to\nthe C form in methanol. We identify the ionophores responsible for the\nexistence of the A- and C-complexes. In both the complexes, the ions' inner\nsphere ligands are mostly water molecules, the ions reside in water clusters.\nIn ethanol-water mixture, the water clusters are large, the major groove of the\nA-DNA is filled with water, and all ionophores are accessible to ions. In\nmethanol-water mixture, the water clusters are small, and a large number of\nmethanol clusters are present near DNA surface. They interfere with the\ncoordination of ions in one of the ionophores of the major groove, and also\nwith other ionophores near phosphates. Therefore, in methanol, the interaction\nenergy of counterions with A-DNA cannot compensate for the repulsion of closely\nlocated phosphates. Therefore, the ions fill more accessible ionophores of the\nC-complex, converting DNA into the C form."}

The method compares the perturbations caused by local\nsequence variants to the energetics of the protein folding process and to the\ncorresponding change to the apparent selection landscape of sequences over the\nevolutionary time scale. The difference between the physical folding free\nenergies and the evolutionary free energies can be called a \"Dark Energy\". We\nanalyse various protein sets and thereby show that Dark Energy is largely\nlocalized at functional sites, which are often energetically frustrated from\nthe point of view of folding. Overall, we find that about 25% of the positions\nof the folded globular proteins display some significant Dark Energy. When a\nfunction relies on a free energy that can be thermodynamically quantified, such\nas a binding energy to a partner, the relationship of this physical free energy\nwith Dark Energy can be used to define a Functional Selection Temperature. We\nshow that selection for folding and binding functions bear similar weights in\nspecific protein-protein interactions."}

Common interactions dominate datasets, while rare but\ncritical interactions remain underrepresented, leading to poor model\nperformance on infrequent cases. Existing methods often treat DDI prediction as\na binary problem, ignoring class-specific nuances and exacerbating bias toward\nfrequent interactions. To address this, we propose a framework combining\nGenerative Flow Networks (GFlowNet) with Variational Graph Autoencoders (VGAE)\nto generate synthetic samples for rare classes, improving model balance and\ngenerate effective and novel DDI pairs. Our approach enhances predictive\nperformance across interaction types, ensuring better clinical reliability."}

This work introduces a nonparametric RC optimization framework that\nincorporates trajectory histories, enabling robust analysis even for irregular\nor incomplete data. The power of the method is demonstrated through\nincreasingly challenging analyses of protein folding dynamics, where it\nprovides accurate committor estimates that pass a stringent validation test and\nyield high-resolution free energy profiles. Its generality is further\nillustrated through applications to dynamics in phase space, a conceptual ocean\ncirculation model, and a longitudinal clinical dataset. These results\ndemonstrate that rare event dynamics can be accurately characterized without\nexhaustive sampling of the configuration space, establishing a general,\nflexible, and robust framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems and\nlongitudinal datasets."}
