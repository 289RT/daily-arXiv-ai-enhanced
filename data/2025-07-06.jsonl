IntFold demonstrates predictive\naccuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art AlphaFold3, while utilizing a\nsuperior customized attention kernel. Beyond standard structure prediction,\nIntFold can be adapted to predict allosteric states, constrained structures,\nand binding affinity through the use of individual adapters. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a novel confidence head to estimate docking quality, offering a more\nnuanced assessment for challenging targets such as antibody-antigen complexes.\nFinally, we share insights gained during the training process of this\ncomputationally intensive model."}

Aquaporin 3 (AQP3), a membrane\nchannel protein, regulates cellular osmotic balance by transporting water and\nosmolytes. Although AQP3 downregulation is associated with disc degeneration,\nits role in apoptosis under hyperosmotic conditions remains unclear. Here, we\ndemonstrate that hyperosmolarity induces AQP3 depletion, suppresses the\nPI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS\naccumulation in NPCs. Lentiviral overexpression of AQP3 restores this pathway,\nattenuates oxidative damage, and reduces apoptosis, preserving disc structure\nin IVDD rat models. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of AQP3 exacerbates\nECM catabolism and NP tissue loss. Our findings reveal that AQP3 deficiency\nunder hyperosmolarity contributes to NPC apoptosis via suppression of\nPI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, potentially creating a pathological cycle of disc\ndegeneration. These results highlight AQP3 as a promising therapeutic target\nfor IVDD."}

While AI agents\noffer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,\nlimiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a\nself-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a\nmulti-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities\nthrough two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning\nstrategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent\nautomatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows\nSTELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring\napproximately 26\\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\\% on LAB-Bench:\nDBQA, and 63\\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6\npercentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance\nsystematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the\nHumanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA\nrepresents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and\ngrow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical\ndiscovery."}

While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they\nremain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple\nexperimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an\nAI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific\nexperiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This\nsystem autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific\nprocedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user\nrequests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and\ninstruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the\nautomation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous\nlaboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse\ninstrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid\nfunctions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It\nalso enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug\ndevelopment, and information storage. Without human intervention, it\nautonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art\nresults achieved by human scientists.

These properties are collectively called `developability'. To\nenable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for\nfavorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model\ntrained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed\nAntibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246\nclinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable\ncandidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module\nthat biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained\nsampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire\nand approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant\nenrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines.

Building on this\nparadigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction\nacross Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein\ninteraction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical\nattributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.\nThe proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that\nemulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The\nframework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a\ndata-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned\nembedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments\non benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data\nregimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to\nother species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and\nfunctional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where\nexperimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical\nfeature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,\nsuch as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances\ncross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction\nprediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data."}
