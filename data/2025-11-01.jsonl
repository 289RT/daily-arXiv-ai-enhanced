For example, Markov models for ion\nchannels often consist of multiple open and closed state to account for \"slow\"\nand \"fast\" openings and closings of the channel. The approach is a popular tool\nin the construction of mechanistic models of ion channels - instead of viewing\nmodel states as generators of sojourn times of a certain characteristic length,\neach individual model state is interpreted as a representation of a distinct\nbiophysical state. We will review the properties of aggregated Markov models\nand discuss the implications for mechanistic modelling. First, we show how the\naggregated Markov models with a given number of states can be calculated using\nP\\'olya enumeration However, models with $n_O$ open and $n_C$ closed states\nthat exceed the maximum number $2 n_O n_C$ of parameters are non-identifiable.\nWe will present two derivations for this classical result and investigate\nnon-identifiability further via a detailed analysis of the non-identifiable\nfully connected three-state model. Finally, we will discuss the implications of\nnon-identifiability for mechanistic modelling of ion channels. We will argue\nthat instead of designing models based on assumed transitions between distinct\nbiophysical states which are modulated by ligand binding, it is preferable to\nbuild models based on additional sources of data that give more direct insight\ninto the dynamics of conformational changes."}

We present RNAGenScape, a\nproperty-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework that iteratively updates\nmRNA sequences within a learned latent manifold. RNAGenScape combines an\norganized autoencoder, which structures the latent space by target properties\nfor efficient and biologically plausible exploration, with a manifold projector\nthat contracts each step of update back to the manifold. RNAGenScape supports\nproperty-guided optimization and smooth interpolation between sequences, while\nremaining robust under scarce and undersampled data, and ensuring that\nintermediate products are close to the viable mRNA manifold. Across three real\nmRNA datasets, RNAGenScape improves the target properties with high success\nrates and efficiency, outperforming various generative or optimization methods\ndeveloped for proteins or non-biological data. By providing continuous,\ndata-aligned trajectories that reveal how edits influence function, RNAGenScape\nestablishes a scalable paradigm for controllable mRNA design and latent space\nexploration in mRNA sequence modeling."}
