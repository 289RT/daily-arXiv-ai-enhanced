Abstract: The rapid expansion of enzyme kinetics literature has outpaced the curation
capabilities of major biochemical databases, creating a substantial barrier to
AI-driven modeling and knowledge discovery. We present zERExtractor, an
automated and extensible platform for comprehensive extraction of
enzyme-catalyzed reaction and activity data from scientific literature.
zERExtractor features a unified, modular architecture that supports
plug-and-play integration of state-of-the-art models, including large language
models (LLMs), as interchangeable components, enabling continuous system
evolution alongside advances in AI. Our pipeline combines domain-adapted deep
learning, advanced OCR, semantic entity recognition, and prompt-driven LLM
modules, together with human expert corrections, to extract kinetic parameters
(e.g., kcat, Km), enzyme sequences, substrate SMILES, experimental conditions,
and molecular diagrams from heterogeneous document formats. Through active
learning strategies integrating AI-assisted annotation, expert validation, and
iterative refinement, the system adapts rapidly to new data sources. We also
release a large benchmark dataset comprising over 1,000 annotated tables and
5,000 biological fields from 270 P450-related enzymology publications.
Benchmarking demonstrates that zERExtractor consistently outperforms existing
baselines in table recognition (Acc 89.9%), molecular image interpretation (up
to 99.1%), and relation extraction (accuracy 94.2%). zERExtractor bridges the
longstanding data gap in enzyme kinetics with a flexible, plugin-ready
framework and high-fidelity extraction, laying the groundwork for future
AI-powered enzyme modeling and biochemical knowledge discovery.

TL;DR: HelixVS是一个基于深度学习的虚拟筛选平台，显著提高了活性化合物的筛选效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟筛选在药物发现中具有降低成本和时间需求的潜力，但如何提升其成本效益仍是一大挑战。

Method: HelixVS结合了深度学习模型和多阶段筛选流程，包括精确的姿势评分模型和姿势筛选模块。

Conclusion: HelixVS能有效识别高亲和力配体，并已公开免费版本以支持药物开发。

Abstract: Drug discovery through virtual screening (VS) has become a popular strategy
for identifying hits against protein targets. VS has the potential to reduce
the cost and time needed for manual selection and wet-laboratory experiments.
Improving the cost-effectiveness of virtual screening is a significant
challenge, aiming to explore larger compound libraries while maintaining lower
screening costs. Here, we present HelixVS, a structure-based VS platform
enhanced by deep learning models. HelixVS integrates a precise deep
learning-based pose-scoring model and a pose-screening module into a
multi-stage VS process, enabling more effective screening of active compounds.
Compared to classic molecular docking tools like Vina, HelixVS demonstrated
significantly improved screening performance across nearly a hundred targets,
achieving an average 2.6-fold higher enrichment factor (EF) and more than 10
times faster screening speed. We applied HelixVS in four drug development
pipelines, targeting both traditional competitive drug-binding pockets and
novel protein-protein interaction interfaces. Wet-lab validations across these
pipelines consistently identified active compounds, with over 10% of the
molecules tested in wet labs demonstrating activity at uM or even nM levels.
This demonstrates the ability of HelixVS to identify high-affinity ligands for
various targets and pockets. Furthermore, we provide a publicly available and
free version of HelixVS with limited computing power to assist drug development
scientists in accelerating their drug discovery processes.

Abstract: Powerful AI tools for drug discovery reside in isolated web apps, desktop
programs, and code libraries. Such fragmentation forces scientists to manage
incompatible interfaces and specialized scripts, which can be a cumbersome and
repetitive process. To address this issue, a Full-pROcess druG dEsign ageNT,
named FROGENT, has been proposed. Specifically, FROGENT utilizes a Large
Language Model and the Model Context Protocol to integrate multiple dynamic
biochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and task-specific AI models.
This agentic framework allows FROGENT to execute complicated drug discovery
workflows dynamically, including component tasks such as target identification,
molecule generation and retrosynthetic planning. FROGENT has been evaluated on
eight benchmarks that cover various aspects of drug discovery, such as
knowledge retrieval, property prediction, virtual screening, mechanistic
analysis, molecular design, and synthesis. It was compared against six
increasingly advanced ReAct-style agents that support code execution and
literature searches. Empirical results demonstrated that FROGENT triples the
best baseline performance in hit-finding and doubles it in interaction
profiling, significantly outperforming both the open-source model Qwen3-32B and
the commercial model GPT-4o. In addition, real-world cases have been utilized
to validate the practicability and generalization of FROGENT. This development
suggests that streamlining the agentic drug discovery pipeline can
significantly enhance researcher productivity.

### [4] [IBEX: Information-Bottleneck-EXplored Coarse-to-Fine Molecular Generation under Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10775)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBEX是一个基于信息瓶颈理论的粗到细的生成模型，用于解决蛋白质-配体复合物数据稀缺问题，提升了药物设计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前三维生成模型在药物发现中受限于公开的蛋白质-配体复合物数据稀缺，导致模型容易过拟合。

Method: IBEX利用PAC-Bayesian信息瓶颈理论量化样本信息密度，结合Scaffold Hopping任务，通过L-BFGS优化步骤精细调整构象。

Result: IBEX将零射对接成功率从53%提升至64%，Vina评分从-7.41 kcal mol⁻¹提高到-8.07 kcal mol⁻¹，并在100个口袋中的57个中表现最佳。

Conclusion: IBEX显著提升了药物设计的生成质量，减少了外推误差，并在多项指标上达到最优。

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

Abstract: Cytoskeletal filaments transported by surface immobilized molecular motors
with one end pinned to the surface have been observed to spiral in a
myosin-driven actin 'gliding assay'. The radius of the spiral was shown to
scale with motor density with an exponent of -1/3, while the frequency was
theoretically predicted to scale with an exponent of 4/3. While both the
spiraling radius and frequency depend on motor density, the theory assumed
independence of filament length, and remained to be tested on cytoskeletal
systems other than actin-myosin. Here, we reconstitute dynein-driven
microtubule spiraling and compare experiments to theory and numerical
simulations. We characterize the scaling laws of spiraling MTs and find the
radius dependence on force density to be consistent with previous results.
Frequency on the other hand scales with force density with an exponent of ~1/3,
contrary to previous predictions. We also predict that the spiral radius scales
proportionally and the frequency scales inversely with filament length, both
with an exponent of ~1/3. A model of variable persistence length best explains
the length dependence observed in experiments. Our findings that reconcile
theory, simulations, and experiments improve our understanding of the role of
cytoskeletal filament elasticity, mechanics of microtubule buckling and motor
transport and the physical principles of active filaments.
