Porter"], "title": "Fold-switching Proteins", "categories": ["q-bio.BM"], "comment": null, "summary": "Globular proteins are expected to assume folds with fixed secondary\nstructures, alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Fold-switching proteins challenge\nthis expectation by remodeling their secondary and/or tertiary structures in\nresponse to cellular stimuli. Though these shapeshifting proteins were once\nthought to be haphazard evolutionary byproducts with little intrinsic\nbiological relevance, recent work has shown that evolution has selected for\ntheir dual-folding behavior, which plays critical roles in biological processes\nacross all kingdoms of life. The widening scope of fold switching draws\nattention to the ways it challenges conventional wisdom, raising fundamental\nunanswered questions about protein structure, biophysics, and evolution. Here\nwe discuss the progress being made to answer these questions and suggest future\ndirections for the field."}
