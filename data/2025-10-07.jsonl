However, existing\npeptide design methods are limited to standard amino acids, leaving NSAA-aware\ndesign largely unexplored. We introduce NS-Pep, a unified framework for\nco-designing peptide sequences and structures with NSAAs. The main challenge is\nthat NSAAs are extremely underrepresented-even the most frequent one, SEP,\naccounts for less than 0.4% of residues-resulting in a severe long-tailed\ndistribution. To improve generalization to rare amino acids, we propose Residue\nFrequency-Guided Modification (RFGM), which mitigates over-penalization through\nfrequency-aware logit calibration, supported by both theoretical and empirical\nanalysis. Furthermore, we identify that insufficient side-chain modeling limits\ngeometric representation of NSAAs. To address this, we introduce Progressive\nSide-chain Perception (PSP) for coarse-to-fine torsion and location prediction,\nand Interaction-Aware Weighting (IAW) to emphasize pocket-proximal residues.\nMoreover, NS-Pep generalizes naturally to the peptide folding task with NSAAs,\naddressing a major limitation of current tools. Experiments show that NS-Pep\nimproves sequence recovery rate and binding affinity by 6.23% and 5.12%,\nrespectively, and outperforms AlphaFold3 by 17.76% in peptide folding success\nrate."}

Here, we demonstrate that the levels of\nmicroRNA (miR)-103a were significantly downregulated in the inflamed mucosa of\nulcerative colitis (UC) patients, along with elevated inflammatory cytokines\n(IL-1beta/TNF-alpha) and reduced tight junction protein (Occludin/ZO-1) levels,\nas compared with healthy control objects. Consistently, miR-103a deficient\nintestinal epithelial cells Caco-2 showed serious inflammatory responses and\nincreased permeability, and DSS induced more severe colitis in miR-103a-/- mice\nthan wild-type ones. Mechanistic studies unraveled that c-FOS suppressed\nmiR-103a transcription via binding to its promoter, then miR-103a-targeted\nNF-kappaB activation contributes to inflammatory responses and barrier\ndisruption by targeting TAB2 and TAK1. Notably, the traditional Chinese\nmedicine Cornus officinalis (CO) and its core active ingredient loganin\npotently mitigated inflammation and barrier disruption in UC by specifically\nblocking the EGFR/RAS/ERK/c-FOS signaling axis, these effects mainly attributed\nto modulated miR-103a levels as the therapeutic activities of them were almost\ncompletely shielded in miR-103a KO mice. Taken together, this work reveals that\nloganin relieves EGFR/c-FOS axis-suppressed epithelial miR-103a expression,\nthereby inhibiting NF-kappaB pathway activation, suppressing inflammatory\nresponses, and preserving tight junction integrity in UC. Thus, our data enrich\nmechanistic insights and promising targets for UC treatment."}

We investigate whether thin contrastive bridges,\nlightweight projection heads over frozen unimodal encoders can align chemical\nand textual representations without training a full multimodal model. Using\npaired mechanisms from ChEMBL, we align ECFP4 molecular fingerprints with\nbiomedical sentence embeddings through dual linear projections trained with a\ncontrastive objective. To better handle drugs sharing the same therapeutic\ntarget, we incorporate hard negative weighting and a margin loss. Evaluation\nunder scaffold based splits, which require generalization across disjoint\nchemical cores, demonstrates that our approach achieves non-trivial cross modal\nalignment and substantially improves within target discrimination compared to\nfrozen baselines. These results suggest that thin bridges offer a compute\nefficient alternative to large scale multimodal pretraining, enabling scaffold\naware drug text alignment and target specific retrieval in precision medicine."}

The Oseen--Frank framework provides a powerful continuum description\nof these phases through three elastic moduli: splay ($K_1$), twist or\ncholesteric ($K_2$), and bending ($K_3$). While $K_1$ is typically assumed to\ndominate, the relative magnitude of $K_2$ and $K_3$ in confined DNA remains\npoorly understood. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy, liquid-crystal\nmodeling, and knot theory to quantify this relationship in bacteriophage P4,\nwhose genome is partially organized in a spool-like liquid-crystalline phase.\nWe first show experimentally that the ordered DNA occupies three concentric\nlayers within the capsid. We then formulate an Oseen--Frank model for this\ngeometry and use it, together with the measured layer radii, to estimate the\nelastic ratio $\\alpha = K_3/K_2$. We find $\\alpha \\approx 0.0064$, indicating\nthat twist elasticity overwhelmingly dominates bending. To validate this\nresult, we perform Langevin dynamics simulations of DNA trajectories and\nclassify the resulting knots. The predicted knot distribution agrees with\nexperimental data from P4, demonstrating consistency between elasticity,\ntopology, and observed genome organization."}

Here, we present\nthe effects of two different empirical energy force fields used for molecular\ndynamics simulations on correlated motions -- the non-polarizable CHARMM 36m\nadditive force field and the polarizable Drude-2019 force field. The study was\nconducted on two proteins, ubiquitin - a small protein with a well-described\ndynamic - and the nuclear receptor protein PPAR___. The ligand binding domain\nof PPAR___ was of particular interest since its function is to regulate\ntranscription through ligand and coregulator protein binding. It has been\npreviously shown that a dynamical network of correlated motions ensures the\ntransmission of information related to PPAR___ ligand binding. We present the\nresults of classical MD simulations where we analyze the results in terms of\nresidue fluctuations, residue correlation maps, community network analysis and\nhydrophobic cluster analysis. We find that RMS fluctuations tend to be greater\nand correlated motions are less intense with Drude-2019 force field than with\nthe non-polarizable all atom additive force field. Analysis of large\nhydrophobic clusters in the respective proteins show a greater loss of native\ncontacts in the simulations using the Drude-2019 force field than in the\nsimulations using the all atom force additive force field. Our results provide\nthe first quantification of the impact of using a polarizable force field in\ncomputational studies that focus on correlated motions."}
