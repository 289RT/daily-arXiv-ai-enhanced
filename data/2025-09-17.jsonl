Given\nthe prohibitive cost and time constraints associated with experimental\nstructure determination, scalable generation of realistic protein-ligand\ncomplexes is needed to expand available datasets for model development. In this\nstudy, we introduce a novel workflow for the procedural generation and\nvalidation of synthetic protein-ligand complexes, combining a diverse ensemble\nof generation techniques and rigorous quality control. We assessed the utility\nof these synthetic datasets by retraining established docking models, Smina and\nGnina, and evaluating their performance on standard benchmarks including the\nPDBBind core set and the PoseBusters dataset. Our results demonstrate that\nmodels trained on synthetic data achieve performance comparable to models\ntrained on experimental data, indicating that current synthetic complexes can\neffectively capture many salient features of protein-ligand interactions.\nHowever, we did not observe significant improvements in docking or scoring\naccuracy over conventional methods or experimental data augmentation. These\nfindings highlight the promise as well as the current limitations of synthetic\ndata for deep learning-based molecular docking and underscore the need for\nfurther refinement in generation methodologies and evaluation strategies to\nfully exploit the potential of synthetic datasets for this application."}

The initial\nstep of fragment identification remains challenging, as fragments often bind\nweakly and non-specifically. We developed a protein-fragment encoder that\nrelies on a contrastive learning approach to map both molecular fragments and\nprotein surfaces in a shared latent space. The encoder captures\ninteraction-relevant features and allows to perform virtual screening as well\nas generative design with our new method LatentFrag. In LatentFrag, fragment\nembeddings and positions are generated conditioned on the protein surface while\nbeing chemically realistic by construction. Our expressive fragment and protein\nrepresentations allow location of protein-fragment interaction sites with high\nsensitivity and we observe state-of-the-art fragment recovery rates when\nsampling from the learned distribution of latent fragment embeddings. Our\ngenerative method outperforms common methods such as virtual screening at a\nfraction of its computational cost providing a valuable starting point for\nfragment hit discovery. We further show the practical utility of LatentFrag and\nextend the workflow to full ligand design tasks. Together, these approaches\ncontribute to advancing fragment identification and provide valuable tools for\nfragment-based drug discovery."}

Deep learning approaches have emerged as promising\nsolutions to overcome these computational limitations by learning to predict\nlong-timescale dynamics. However, generalizable kinetics models for proteins\nremain largely unexplored, and the fundamental limits of achievable\nacceleration while preserving dynamical accuracy are poorly understood. In this\nwork, we fill this gap with DeepJump, an Euclidean-Equivariant Flow\nMatching-based model for predicting protein conformational dynamics across\nmultiple temporal scales. We train DeepJump on trajectories of the diverse\nproteins of mdCATH, systematically studying our model's performance in\ngeneralizing to long-term dynamics of fast-folding proteins and characterizing\nthe trade-off between computational acceleration and prediction accuracy. We\ndemonstrate the application of DeepJump to ab initio folding, showcasing\nprediction of folding pathways and native states. Our results demonstrate that\nDeepJump achieves significant $\\approx$1000$\\times$ computational acceleration\nwhile effectively recovering long-timescale dynamics, providing a stepping\nstone for enabling routine simulation of proteins."}
