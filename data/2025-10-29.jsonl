Embedding a field term into the Eyring expression,\ndemonstrated that plausible local EMFs with realistic dipole changes accelerate\nrate constants by orders of magnitude. This local acceleration reconciles the\ndiscrepancy between predicted vs. observed rates of H2O2-mediated cysteine\noxidation. The framework generates falsifiable predictions, such as vibrational\nStark readouts in thiolate peroxide complexes should fall within predicted\nranges, and reframes rate-constants as mutable, field conditioned parameters.\nCysteine redox sensing is fast not because the chemistry is exotic, but because\nthe physics is local."}
