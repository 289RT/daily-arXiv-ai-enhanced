We address this limitation by enforcing physical\nvalidity as a strict constraint during both training and inference with a\nuniffed module. At its core is a differentiable projection that maps the\nprovisional atom coordinates from the diffusion model to the nearest physically\nvalid conffguration. This projection is achieved using a Gauss-Seidel scheme,\nwhich exploits the locality and sparsity of the constraints to ensure stable\nand fast convergence at scale. By implicit differentiation to obtain gradients,\nour module integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks for end-to-end\nffnetuning. With our Gauss-Seidel projection module in place, two denoising\nsteps are sufffcient to produce biomolecular complexes that are both physically\nvalid and structurally accurate. Across six benchmarks, our 2-step model\nachieves the same structural accuracy as state-of-the-art 200-step diffusion\nbaselines, delivering approximately 10 times faster wall-clock speed while\nguaranteeing physical validity.", "AI": {"tldr": "", "motivation": "", "method": "", "result": "", "conclusion": ""}}
