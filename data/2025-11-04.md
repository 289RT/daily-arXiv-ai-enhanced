Abstract: Potential Energy Surfaces (PESs) are an indispensable tool to investigate,
characterise and understand chemical and biological systems in the gas and
condensed phases. Advances in Machine Learning (ML) methodologies have led to
the development of Machine Learned Potential Energy Surfaces (ML-PES) which are
now widely used to simulate such systems. The present work provides an overview
of concepts, methodologies and recommendations for constructing and using
ML-PESs. The choice of topics is focused on practical and recurrent issues to
conceive and use such model. Application of the principles discussed are
illustrated through two different systems of biomolecular importance: the
non-reactive dynamics of the Alanine-Lysine-Alanine tripeptide in gas and
solution phases, and double proton transfer reactions in DNA base pairs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework in generative modeling,
showing significant potential to accelerate and transform the traditionally
slow and costly process of drug discovery. This review provides a systematic
comparison of their application in designing two principal therapeutic
modalities: small molecules and therapeutic peptides. We analyze how a unified
framework of iterative denoising is adapted to the distinct molecular
representations, chemical spaces, and design objectives of each modality. For
small molecules, these models excel at structure-based design, generating
novel, pocket-fitting ligands with desired physicochemical properties, yet face
the critical hurdle of ensuring chemical synthesizability. Conversely, for
therapeutic peptides, the focus shifts to generating functional sequences and
designing de novo structures, where the primary challenges are achieving
biological stability against proteolysis, ensuring proper folding, and
minimizing immunogenicity. Despite these distinct challenges, both domains face
shared hurdles: the need for more accurate scoring functions, the scarcity of
high-quality experimental data, and the crucial requirement for experimental
validation. We conclude that the full potential of diffusion models will be
unlocked by bridging these modality-specific gaps and integrating them into
automated, closed-loop Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) platforms, thereby
shifting the paradigm from chemical exploration to the targeted creation of
novel therapeutics.
