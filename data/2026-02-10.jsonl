Nikolaidis"], "title": "A Mathematical Theory of Redox Biology", "categories": ["q-bio.BM"], "comment": "41 pages, 4 figures, 2 boxes", "summary": "Redox biology underpins signalling, metabolism, immunity, and adaptation, yet lacks a unifying theoretical framework capable of formalising structure, function, and dynamics. Current interpretations rely on descriptive catalogues of molecules and reactions, obscuring how redox behaviour emerges from constrained biochemical organisation. Here, we present a mathematical theory of redox biology that resolves this gap by treating redox systems as finite, compositional, dynamical, and spatially embedded objects. We define a structured redox state space in which admissible molecular transformations form a neutral algebra of possibilities. Biological function emerges when this structure is embedded within a wider molecular network and interpreted through weighted flux distributions. Time-dependent reweighting of these transformations generates redox dynamics, while spatial embedding enforces locality and causality, yielding a distributed redox field. Within this framework, context dependence, nonlinearity, hysteresis, and memory arise naturally from bounded state spaces and irreversible transformations, without requiring ad hoc assumptions. This theory provides a working, predictive interpretative basis for redox biology: it constrains admissible states and trajectories, clarifies the meaning of redox measurements, and links chemical transformation to biological behaviour. Redox biology emerges as a geometric, dynamical process governed by lawful organisation."}

Current deep learning approaches to structure-based drug design rely on expensive all-atom diffusion to generate 3D coordinates, creating inference bottlenecks that render large-scale compound screening computationally intractable. We challenge this paradigm with a critical hypothesis: full all-atom resolution is unnecessary for accurate small molecule pose and binding affinity prediction. TerraBind tests this hypothesis through a coarse pocket-level representation (protein C$_β$ atoms and ligand heavy atoms only) within a multimodal architecture combining COATI-3 molecular encodings and ESM-2 protein embeddings that learns rich structural representations, which are used in a diffusion-free optimization module for pose generation and a binding affinity likelihood prediction module. On structure prediction benchmarks (FoldBench, PoseBusters, Runs N' Poses), TerraBind matches diffusion-based baselines in ligand pose accuracy. Crucially, TerraBind outperforms Boltz-2 by $\\sim$20\\% in Pearson correlation for binding affinity prediction on both a public benchmark (CASP16) and a diverse proprietary dataset (18 biochemical/cell assays). We show that the affinity prediction module also provides well-calibrated affinity uncertainty estimates, addressing a critical gap in reliable compound prioritization for drug discovery. Furthermore, this module enables a continual learning framework and a hedged batch selection strategy that, in simulated drug discovery cycles, achieves 6$\\times$ greater affinity improvement of selected molecules over greedy-based approaches."}

In this work, we perform a rigorous comparative analysis of three simulation schemes, designed to mimic evolution in silico by local sampling of the probability distribution defined by a generative model. We compare standard independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo on a phylogenetic tree, and a population genetics dynamics, benchmarking their outputs against deep sequencing data from four distinct in vitro evolution experiments. We find that standard Monte Carlo fails to reproduce the correct phylogenetic structure and generates unrealistic, gradual mutational sweeps. Performing Monte Carlo on a tree inferred from data improves phylogenetic fidelity and historical accuracy. The population genetics scheme successfully captures phylogenetic correlations, mutational abundances, and selective sweeps as emergent properties, without the need to infer additional information from data. However, the latter choice come at the price of not sampling the proper generative model distribution at long times. Our findings highlight the crucial role of phylogenetic correlations and finite-population effects in shaping evolutionary trajectories on fitness landscapes. These models therefore provide powerful tools for predicting complex adaptive paths and for reliably extrapolating evolutionary dynamics beyond current experimental limitations."}
