Motivation: 研究如何在蛋白质上远距离位点之间的分子结合行为相互影响，以解释别构调控现象。

Method: 采用离散微分几何的方法，特别是n-单形的量子化版本，并结合电子离域的概念来建模蛋白质相互作用。

Result: 通过模型推导，别构调控现象可以从相互作用的定义中自然推导出来。

Conclusion: 希望此研究能为数学家提供一个研究化学和分子生物学的起点。

Abstract: Proteins are the workhorse molecules of the cell and perform their biological
functions by binding to other molecules through physical contact. Protein
function is then regulated through coupling of bindings on the protein
(allosteric regulation). Just as the genetic code provides the blueprint for
protein synthesis, the coupling is thought to provide the basis for protein
communication and interaction. However, it is not yet fully understood how
binding of a molecule at one site affects binding of another molecule at
another distal site on a protein, even more than $60$ years after its discovery
in 1961. In this paper, I propose a simple mathematical model of protein
interactions, using a ``quantized'' version of differential geometry, i.e., the
discrete differential geometry of $n$-simplices. The model is based on the
concept of electron delocalization, one of the main features of quantum
chemistry, Allosteric regulation then follows tautologically from the
definition of interactions. No prior knowledge of conventional discrete
differential geometry, protein science, or quantum chemistry is required. I
hope this paper will provide a starting point for many mathematicians to study
chemistry and molecular biology.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause up to 10 million deaths
annually by 2050, underscoring the urgent need for new antibiotics. Here we
present ApexAmphion, a deep-learning framework for de novo design of
antibiotics that couples a 6.4-billion-parameter protein language model with
reinforcement learning. The model is first fine-tuned on curated peptide data
to capture antimicrobial sequence regularities, then optimised with proximal
policy optimization against a composite reward that combines predictions from a
learned minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) classifier with differentiable
physicochemical objectives. In vitro evaluation of 100 designed peptides showed
low MIC values (nanomolar range in some cases) for all candidates (100% hit
rate). Moreover, 99 our of 100 compounds exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial
activity against at least two clinically relevant bacteria. The lead molecules
killed bacteria primarily by potently targeting the cytoplasmic membrane. By
unifying generation, scoring and multi-objective optimization with deep
reinforcement learning in a single pipeline, our approach rapidly produces
diverse, potent candidates, offering a scalable route to peptide antibiotics
and a platform for iterative steering toward potency and developability within
hours.
