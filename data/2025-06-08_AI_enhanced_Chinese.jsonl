Unlike existing\nantibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity\nto natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench\nconsiders an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and\nevaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by\nmeasuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,\nstandardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,\nanti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain\nmutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein\nmodels including masked language models, autoregressive language models,\ninverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph\nmodels. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity\nvalues is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to\nincrease binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we\nevaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of\nnew antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural\nintegrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,\nstructure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity\ncorrelation and generation tasks.

The model implements a triple-stream attention framework\nincorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention\nfor material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample\nrelationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily\nmeasurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional\nperformance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999\nacross all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models\nand existing machine learning approaches.

However, creating the training dataset for their skill\nacquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires\nsignificant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks\nto learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are\nactually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful\nlearning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To\naddress this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for\nLLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target\nbehaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an\nexploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train\nthe target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.\nSpecifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively\ngenerate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to\ntrain Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice\nevaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback\nthen guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data\ngeneration process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's\nability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the\ncapabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving\nsubstantial performance improvements.

In this work, we investigate how transformers\nperform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,\n\\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly\nrelated items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs\n(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior\nacross two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models\nstore information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where\nmodels flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our\nfindings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards\ntransitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL\nmodels trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.\nMechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that\nimplement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating\nadjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among\nindirectly related items.

Experiments\ndemonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,\npaving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.\nFurthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured\ngeneration, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08Schema\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfShape Expressions\uff08ShEx\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u5f0f\u521b\u5efa\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM-based pipelines\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210ShEx\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165YAGO Schema\u548cWikidata EntitySchema\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLLMs\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684ShEx\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

The first process is anatomical in nature: the\ntarget ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements\nrelating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is\nconsidered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion\nfor selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the\nmore useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and\nrelates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak\nlogarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax\nlayers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class\nlogic as that faced by the output layer.

This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate\ngovernance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world\ncorporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set\nof governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task\nis one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent\nwith the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following\nestablished principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate\ngovernance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters\nselected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life\ncorporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models\nconfirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet\nand GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents\nexhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct\nframeworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the\nadvanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the\nbenchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current\nreasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning\ncapabilities of SOTA models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\uff08CHANCERY\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u7ae0\u7a0b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\u7565\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e24\u6761\u516c\u53f8\u6cbb\u7406\u539f\u5219\u548c79\u4efd\u771f\u5b9e\u516c\u53f8\u7ae0\u7a0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5224\u65ad\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u7ae0\u7a0b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86SOTA\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "Claude 3.7 Sonnet\u548cGPT-4o\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a64.5%\u548c75.2%\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8eReAct\u548cCodeAct\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0876.1%\u548c78.1%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6cd5\u5f8bAI\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Of course, the process of\ncreating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training\nruns which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and\noutput encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),\nindeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of\nlosses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing\nloss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard\ngradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular\nparameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the\ndifferentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for\noptimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel\nlayer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the\ninherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding\ndegenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization\nscheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,\nwhich models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring\nboundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in\njointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one\nshot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across\nstate-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D\nestimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently\noutperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data.

However, e-bike incident reports\noften use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety\nanalysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large\nlanguage models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables\nfrom unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,\nhandling data classification, information extraction, injury cause\ndetermination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could\nlead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we\nused an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of\nthe incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and\nenvironmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly\nmore common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often\nfatal.

Despite the substantial\nempirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular\nunderstanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on\nreasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been\nhypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)\nproblem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.\nUsing this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,\nproviding models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades\nperformance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit\ngreater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their\nbase counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the\nexecution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow\ninternal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes.

A critical challenge for continual\nlearning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks\ndecreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to\nmitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce\nforgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new\ntraining episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample\nreplay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each\ntask is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be\nable to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and\nhighlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task\nsubspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting\ncan be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present\ntasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also\nin distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases\nforgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay\nis not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a\nneural networks equipped with SGD.

Tailored for\nsettings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method\nincreases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in\nmeta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional\nNeural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in\nmeta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG\nmeta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline\nmanner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model\nfrom a single test task rollout with unknown parameters.

We prove that the gap between the\nCL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under\na bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.\n  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL\nloss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class\ncollapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We\nfurther introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This\nbound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion\nand variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional\nvariation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect\ndiminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable\nCL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery\nusing simple linear probes.\n  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL\nand NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\#\\text{classes}})$;\nthe two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings\nthe NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the\nproposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance\nin practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u76ee\u6807\u9690\u542b\u5730\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u201d\uff08NSCL\uff09\u7684\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u586b\u8865\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4e0e\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNSCL\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0eCL\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eCL\u548cNSCL\u635f\u5931\u5dee\u8ddd\u968f\u7c7b\u522b\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "CL\u9690\u542b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e8eNSCL\uff0c\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known\npre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed\ngrokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR\nthrough the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality\nmetric $\\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing\nmetrics detect only the first two. The \\emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by\ntraining for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\\alpha < 2$ and the\nappearance of \\emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the\nrandomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and\nsignal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual\ninspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using\nKolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including\nactivation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$\nweight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking\nfrom anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and\ngeneralization collapse without direct access to the test data.

We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing\nlink functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the\nlink. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing\nhigh slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a\nmodel and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity\nregions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low\nimportance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed\nwith scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,\nhowever, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks\nranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.\nUtilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for\nmultidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard\nSoftmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction\nbetween adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over\ntraditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including\ndwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive\npairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment\nof Large Language Models (LLMs).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f97\u5206\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u533a\u57df\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eSigmoid\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5f26\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5408Softmax\u51fd\u6570\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533a\u5206\u91cd\u8981\u5f97\u5206\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed\nexploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying\ndifficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In\nthis paper, we propose \\textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \\textit{LLM\nSelf-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search\nstrategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via\nself-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or\nhardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path\nor explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This\nenables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual\ntuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku\nagainst three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth\nFirst Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which\nhave been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning\ntasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without\nadditional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other\nmethods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with\nstronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with\nincreased compute budget.

We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for\nmodel and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be\npreferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use\nderived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's\nstronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard\nCLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for\nvarious downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for\ndifferent open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the\nsame trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving\nscaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.\nAccurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and\ndataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on\nmeasurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic\ncomparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their\ncreation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate\ncheckpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\\%$ zero-shot\nImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B.

Recent work has linked\nEBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained\nthrough a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the\ninstabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work\nwith bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize\nan upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on\nthe log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds\nbased on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual\ninformation.

We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed\nacyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths\ncorrespond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in\nthe real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize\nthe task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements\nlike safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully\nanalyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In\nthis work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible\nagent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also\nknown as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition\nwhere the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We\nintroduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a\nnear-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a\nunion bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the\napproximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical\nloss functions.

Personalizing certain\nparts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts\nto differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.\nHowever, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client\ndrift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby\nreducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL\nframework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),\nreferred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented\nLagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal\nterms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction\nand the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and\nshared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit\nestimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of\nconvergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global\nconvergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary\npoint, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under\nmild assumptions.

In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel\nlikelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that\ninterchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL\nframework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model\ndensities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)\ncontinuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)\nconvex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences\nsuch as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical\nframework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q\n= p/\\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact\nbounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form\nexpression for the truncated density approximation.

HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop\nefficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve\nfaster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x\nrespectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,\nHMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be\nchanged without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks\nin a zero-shot manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "HMAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbVAR\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3VAR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u8c03\u5ea6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\uff08HMAR\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0b\u4e00\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u63a7\u591a\u6b65\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet 256x256\u548c512x512\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHMAR\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eVAR\u3001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "HMAR\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Fine-tuning of\nLLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels\nfrom CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)\nin high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =\n{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1\nscore across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and\nALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different\nprivacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a\nclear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets\nand 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned\nmodels achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on\nCT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.\nConclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and\nprivacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,\naddressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u653e\u5c04\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u654f\u611f\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MIMIC-CXR\u548cCT-RATE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DP-LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0b\uff0cDP\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u975e\u79c1\u5bc6\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.88\u548c0.59\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5fae\u8c03\u7ed3\u5408LoRA\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u62a5\u544a\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Reducing particle\ncount accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising\nlow-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose\ngeneration.\n  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT\nplans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and\nhigh-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,\nrespectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,\nnormalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done\non 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed\nidentically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input\nand high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean\nsquare error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%\ndose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH\nindices.\n  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172\n(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%\n(3%/2mm) across all sites.

Specifically, we identify the impact of a\nkey family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call\ncross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust\nclassification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a\nsynthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model\narchitectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the\nmodel tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness\ncheckpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust\noverfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific\nfeatures.

However,\ncurrent synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as\nmultiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category\nlabels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce\nGen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer\nDiffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks\nand diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt\nagent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground\ninstance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the\ngeneration of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and\nclean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out\nlow-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are\nrefined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine\nmultiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data\napproaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from\n50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance\nsegmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m.

Unlike prior methods that rely on a\nseparate step reward model, \\name directly estimates these rewards through this\nsampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of\nGRPO, \\name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated\nduring tree sampling. This advancement allows \\name to produce fine-grained and\ndense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall\nperformance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \\name algorithm\nsubstantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test\nbenchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\\% to 35.5\\%. Furthermore, \\name\nsignificantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\\% in performance while simultaneously\nreducing the average response length by 18.1\\%, showcasing its effectiveness\nand efficiency.

We address these gaps by introducing a\nholistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five\nsafe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both\ntraining and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented\nwith a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token\nencodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language\nmodel toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable\nharmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show\nthat SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety\nperformance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe\nbenchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models.

However, computing exact\nShapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature\ndimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic\nrandomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used\nbeing the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators\nsuch as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &\nWitter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for\nKernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework\nthat encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with\nand without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong\nnon-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our\nframework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical\nguarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing\nestimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional\ndatasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact\nShapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest\nsample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to\nenable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets.
