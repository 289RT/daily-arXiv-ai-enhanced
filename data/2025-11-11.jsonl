In this work, we introduce a novel hierarchical autoregressive framework for modeling protein dynamics that leverages the intrinsic multi-scale organization of molecular motions. Unlike existing methods that focus on generating static conformational ensembles or treat dynamic sampling as an independent process, our approach characterizes protein dynamics as a Markovian process. The framework employs a two-scale architecture: a low-resolution model captures slow, collective motions driving major conformational transitions, while a high-resolution model generates detailed local fluctuations conditioned on these large-scale movements. This hierarchical design ensures that the causal dependencies inherent in protein dynamics are preserved, enabling the generation of temporally coherent and physically realistic trajectories. By bridging high-level biophysical principles with state-of-the-art generative modeling, our approach provides an efficient framework for simulating protein dynamics that balances computational efficiency with physical accuracy."}

In this study, we used all atom molecular dynamics simulation techniques to investigate the interaction of a promising cationic SNAPP architecture (Alt-SNAPP with 8 arms made of alternating lysine and valine residues) with modelled Gram-negative, Gram-positive, mammalian, and red blood cell membranes. Alt-SNAPP exhibited rapid and stable binding to bacterial membranes, driven by electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), and supported by membrane fluidity. In contrast, mammalian and red blood cell membranes, enriched in zwitterionic lipids and cholesterol, resisted peptide association entirely. Analyses of center of mass distance, partial density, hydrogen bonding, and interaction energy confirmed that SNAPP remains fully excluded from host like membranes while forming stable, multivalent interactions with bacterial bilayers. These findings provide mechanistic insight into membrane selectivity of SNAPP and offer a molecular framework for designing next generation antimicrobial polymers with minimal off target toxicity."}

Recent studies have highlighted the circadian rhythm critical role in AD pathophysiology, implicating circadian clock kinases, such as the Salt-Inducible Kinase 3 (SIK3), as promising therapeutic target. Generative AI models have surpassed traditional methods of drug discovery, untapping the vast unexplored chemical space of drug-like molecules. We present a sequence-to-sequence Variational Autoencoder (Seq2Seq-VAE) model guided by an Active Learning (AL) approach to optimize molecular generation. Our pipeline iteratively guided a pre-trained Seq2Seq-VAE model towards the pharmacological landscape relevant to SIK3 using a two-step framework, an inner loop that iteratively improves physiochemical properties profile, drug likeliness and synthesizability, followed by an outer loop that steer the latent space towards high-affinity ligands for SIK3. Our approach introduces feedback-driven optimization without requiring large labeled datasets, making it particularly suited for early-stage drug discovery in under-explored therapeutic targets. Our results demonstrate the models convergence toward SIK3-specific small molecules with desired properties and high binding affinity. This work highlights the use of generative AI combined with AL for rational drug discovery that can be extended to other protein targets with minimal modifications, offering a scalable solution to the molecular design bottleneck in drug design."}
