Abstract: The specific region of an antibody responsible for binding to an antigen,
known as the paratope, is essential for immune recognition. Accurate
identification of this small yet critical region can accelerate the development
of therapeutic antibodies. Determining paratope locations typically relies on
modeling the antibody structure, which is computationally intensive and
difficult to scale across large antibody repertoires. We introduce Paraplume, a
sequence-based paratope prediction method that leverages embeddings from
protein language models (PLMs), without the need for structural input and
achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks compared to current
methods. In addition, reweighting PLM embeddings using Paraplume predictions
yields more informative sequence representations, improving downstream tasks
such as affinity prediction, binder classification, and epitope binning.
Applied to large antibody repertoires, Paraplume reveals that antigen-specific
somatic hypermutations are associated with larger paratopes, suggesting a
potential mechanism for affinity enhancement. Our findings position PLM-based
paratope prediction as a powerful, scalable alternative to structure-dependent
approaches, opening new avenues for understanding antibody evolution.
