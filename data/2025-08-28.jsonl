Most existing methods either rely solely on sequence\nembeddings or struggle to capture complex structural relationships, thus\nlimiting predictive performance. In this work, we present a novel framework\nthat integrates sequence-based representations from pre-trained protein\nlanguage models (ESM-2) with a set of topological features. Specifically, we\nextract contact map metrics reflecting residue-level connectivity, interface\ngeometry descriptors characterizing cross-chain interactions, distance map\nstatistics quantifying spatial organization, and persistent homology invariants\nthat systematically capture the emergence and persistence of multi-scale\ntopological structures - such as connected components, cycles, and cavities -\nwithin individual proteins and across the antibody-antigen interface. By\nleveraging a cross-attention mechanism to fuse these diverse modalities, our\nmodel effectively encodes both global and local structural organization,\nthereby substantially enhancing the prediction of binding free energy.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms\nsequence-only and conventional structural models, achieving state-of-the-art\naccuracy in binding free energy prediction."}

Cobley"], "title": "Modal Geometry Governs Proteoform Dynamics", "categories": ["q-bio.BM"], "comment": "23 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "A central mystery is how a specific proteoform, a distinct molecular variant\nof a protein, dynamically shapes its own future by evolving into new modes that\nexist only in potential until realised. Here, Modal Geometric Field (MGF)\nTheory couples real and abstract proteoform transitions through four axioms.\nAxioms one-three (invariant) dictate that only first-order transitions occur on\nthe discrete, volume invariant, non symplectic modal manifold. Axiom four\n(mutable) functorially projects the general relativity derived curvature of an\ninstantiated proteoform into this modal manifold, coupling what is real to what\nis abstract. Curvature, conserved per a discrete Noether theorem, actively\nshapes proteoform dynamics. Because curvature distribution renders activation\nenergy relative, curvature-derived barriers are mutable, in direct analogy to\ngeneral relativity. Entropy then emerges inevitably from curvature transport.\nThis unification of energy, entropy, and curvature yields hysteresis, path\ndependence, fractal self similarity, and trajectories that oscillate between\norder and chaos. As a scale invariant and universal framework, MGF Theory\nreveals how modal geometry governs proteoform dynamics."}

By integrating computational models, machine\nlearning tools, and experimental platforms, this system aims to replicate and\npredict both physiological and pathological processes, ranging from molecules\nand cells to tissues, organs, and entire body systems. Central to the Full-Body\nAI Agent is its emphasis on integration and coordination across these\nbiological levels, enabling analysis of how molecular changes influence\ncellular behaviors, tissue responses, organ function, and systemic outcomes.\nWith a focus on biological functionality, the system is designed to advance the\nunderstanding of disease mechanisms, support the development of therapeutic\ninterventions, and enhance personalized medicine. We propose two specialized\nimplementations to demonstrate the utility of this framework: (1) the\nmetastasis AI Agent, a multi-scale metastasis scoring system that characterizes\ntumor progression across the initiation, dissemination, and colonization phases\nby integrating molecular, cellular, and systemic signals; and (2) the drug AI\nAgent, a system-level drug development paradigm in which a drug AI-Agent\ndynamically guides preclinical evaluations, including organoids and chip-based\nmodels, by providing full-body physiological constraints. This approach enables\nthe predictive modeling of long-term efficacy and toxicity beyond what\nlocalized models alone can achieve. These two agents illustrate the potential\nof Full-Body AI Agent to address complex biomedical challenges through\nmulti-level integration and cross-scale reasoning."}
