In so-called inverse\nprotein folding, the objective is to find a sequence of amino acids that adopts\na target protein structure. Many inverse folding methods struggle to predict\nsequences for complexes that contain non-protein components, and perform poorly\nwith complexes that adopt multiple structural states. To address these\nchallenges, we present ADFLIP (All-atom Discrete FLow matching Inverse Protein\nfolding), a generative model based on discrete flow-matching for designing\nprotein sequences conditioned on all-atom structural contexts. ADFLIP\nprogressively incorporates predicted amino acid side chains as structural\ncontext during sequence generation and enables the design of dynamic protein\ncomplexes through ensemble sampling across multiple structural states.\nFurthermore, ADFLIP implements training-free classifier guidance sampling,\nwhich allows the incorporation of arbitrary pre-trained models to optimise the\ndesigned sequence for desired protein properties. We evaluated the performance\nof ADFLIP on protein complexes with small-molecule ligands, nucleotides, or\nmetal ions, including dynamic complexes for which structure ensembles were\ndetermined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in single-structure and multi-structure inverse\nfolding tasks, demonstrating excellent potential for all-atom protein design.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/ykiiiiii/ADFLIP."}

This report\nhighlights key insights, future challenges, and research priorities identified\nduring the CECAM workshop \"Computations Meet Experiments to Advance the\nEnzymatic Depolymerization of Plastics One Atom at a Time\", held in Trieste\nfrom May 6-8, 2025. The workshop brought together an interdisciplinary\ncommunity of scientists focused on advancing the sustainable use of plastics\nthrough enzyme-based degradation. A key point from the discussions is that many\nbottlenecks in enzymatic recycling arise not only from process engineering\nchallenges, but also from a limited understanding of the underlying molecular\nmechanisms. We argue that constraints on economic viability and sustainability\n(e.g., harsh solvents, high temperatures, substrate crystallinity,\npretreatments) can-and should-be addressed directly through enzyme design,\nprovided these factors are understood at the molecular level, in synergy with\nprocess optimization. For this, it is essential to rely on the integration of\nexperimental and computational approaches to uncover the molecular and\nmechanistic basis of enzymatic plastic degradation. We highlight how the\nsmall-format structure of the workshop, in line with the usual CECAM format,\nfostered a collaborative, friendly, and relaxed atmosphere. We hope this report\nencourages future initiatives and the formation of shared consortia to support\nan open, collaborative, and bio-based plastic recycling community."}

However,\ntheir limited sensitivity hinders their use in complex clinical applications\nthat require accurate biomarker quantification for precise medicine. To address\nthis limitation, we evaluated Bright-Dtech___-614 Europium nanoparticles to\nenhance LFIA assay sensitivity. These nanoparticles exhibited a luminescence\nquantum yield of 70 % and a 90 % conjugation efficacy with antibodies by direct\nadsorption. Considering these properties, we developed an LFIA to quantify\nhuman lactate dehydrogenase (h-LDH), a biomarker and therapeutic target in\ncancer disease. The Bright-Dtech___-614 Eu nanoparticle-based assay achieved a\ndetection limit of 38 pg mL -1 , representing a 686-fold, 15-fold, and 2.9-fold\nimprovement in sensitivity over conventional LFIA platforms using gold (AuNPs),\ncarbon nanoparticles, and standard ELISA, respectively. The assay exhibited\nstrong accuracy, with a mean recovery rate of 108 $\\pm$ 11 %, and demonstrated\nexcellent reproducibility, as evidenced by inter-and intra-batch RSD values of\n4.9 % and 9.7 %, respectively, when testing LDH-spiked serum samples.

Biomolecules within plants serve as key\nstress indicators, offering vital markers for continuous health monitoring and\nearly disease detection. Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful, non-invasive\nmeans to quantify these biomolecules through their molecular vibrational\nsignatures. However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized\ndata-processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and\nprior identification of Raman peaks of interest-introducing potential biases\nand inconsistencies. Here, we introduce DIVA (Deep-learning-based Investigation\nof Vibrational Raman spectra for plant-stress Analysis), a fully automated\nworkflow based on a variational autoencoder. Unlike conventional approaches,\nDIVA processes native Raman spectra-including fluorescence backgrounds-without\nmanual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spectral features\nin an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses,\nincluding abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic\nstressors (bacterial infections). By integrating deep learning with vibrational\nspectroscopy, DIVA paves the way for AI-driven plant health assessment,\nfostering more resilient and sustainable agricultural practices."}
