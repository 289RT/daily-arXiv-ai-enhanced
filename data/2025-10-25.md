*Raghu K. Moorthy,Eoin Casey*

Main category: q-bio.BM

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前数学模型假设生物膜基质为均质，忽略了对细胞外空间的详细机械理解的需求。

Method: 引入了细胞-胶囊方法，将细菌胶囊视为独立的低扩散相，研究其对氧气传输的影响。

Result: 厚胶囊/密集基质排列可减少约70%的局部氧气传输。

Conclusion: 生物膜的胶囊结构作为‘串联电阻’屏障，可能在早期生物膜发展中限制氧气传输。

Abstract: The extracellular matrix of biofilms presents a dense and intricate
architecture. Numerous biophysical properties of the matrix surrounding
microbial cells contribute to the heterogeneity of biofilms and their functions
at the microscale. Previous mathematical models assume the matrix to be
homogeneous, often overlooking the need for a detailed mechanistic
understanding of the extracellular space. In this theoretical study, we
introduce a novel cell-capsule approach to investigate geometric patterns in
biofilm morphology and predict their role in oxygen transport. The thickness of
the capsule and the arrangement of cell-capsule patterns can influence matrix
heterogeneity, providing a clear picture of biofilm structure. By incorporating
the bacterial capsule as a distinct, low-diffusivity phase, our novel
cell-capsule model reveals that this architecture acts as a significant
'resistance-in-series' barrier. We found that a thick capsule/dense matrix
arrangement can reduce local oxygen transfer by approximately 70%, a
substantial drop that may give drive further research into oxygen limitations
during early stage biofilm development.

### [2] [Predicting Protein-Nucleic Acid Flexibility Using Persistent Sheaf Laplacians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20788)
*Nicole Hayes,Ekaterina Merkurjev,Guo-Wei Wei*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于持久束拉普拉斯（PSL）框架的新方法，用于预测蛋白质-核酸复合物的B因子，相比传统模型在多尺度相互作用捕捉上表现更优，性能提升高达21%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质-核酸复合物的灵活性对其结构、动态和功能至关重要，但传统模型如GNM和ENM难以准确捕捉多尺度相互作用，尤其在复杂生物分子系统中。

Method: 采用PSL框架，结合多尺度分析、代数拓扑、组合拉普拉斯和束理论，通过其谐波谱揭示拓扑不变量，并通过非谐波谱捕捉数据的同伦形状演化。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上测试，PSL在B因子预测中显著优于GNM和mFRI模型，Pearson相关系数最高提升21%。

Conclusion: PSL展现了在复杂生物分子相互作用建模中的鲁棒性和适应性，有望在突变影响分析和药物设计等领域发挥更广泛作用。

Abstract: Understanding the flexibility of protein-nucleic acid complexes, often
characterized by atomic B-factors, is essential for elucidating their
structure, dynamics, and functions, such as reactivity and allosteric pathways.
Traditional models such as Gaussian Network Models (GNM) and Elastic Network
Models (ENM) often fall short in capturing multiscale interactions, especially
in large or complex biomolecular systems. In this work, we apply the Persistent
Sheaf Laplacian (PSL) framework for the B-factor prediction of protein-nucleic
acid complexes. The PSL model integrates multiscale analysis, algebraic
topology, combinatoric Laplacians, and sheaf theory for data representation. It
reveals topological invariants in its harmonic spectra and captures the
homotopic shape evolution of data with its non-harmonic spectra. Its
localization enables accurate B-factor predictions. We benchmark our method on
three diverse datasets, including protein-RNA and nucleic-acid-only structures,
and demonstrate that PSL consistently outperforms existing models such as GNM
and multiscale FRI (mFRI), achieving up to a 21% improvement in Pearson
correlation coefficient for B-factor prediction. These results highlight the
robustness and adaptability of PSL in modeling complex biomolecular
interactions and suggest its potential utility in broader applications such as
mutation impact analysis and drug design.

### [3] [BadGraph: A Backdoor Attack Against Latent Diffusion Model for Text-Guided Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20792)
*Liang Ye,Shengqin Chen,Jiazhu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadGraph是一种针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的背门攻击方法，利用文本触发器植入后门，在推理时生成攻击者指定的子图。实验证明其高效且隐蔽，需加强防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型在安全方面尚未充分研究，本文旨在揭示其背门攻击的脆弱性，尤其是在药物发现等应用中。

Method: 通过文本触发器毒化训练数据，隐式植入后门，确保干净输入性能不受影响，而在触发器出现时诱导攻击者指定的子图。

Result: 实验显示，即使中毒率低于10%，攻击成功率可达50%；中毒率24%时成功率超过80%，且对良性样本性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的严重安全风险，强调了在这些模型中构建防御的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.
