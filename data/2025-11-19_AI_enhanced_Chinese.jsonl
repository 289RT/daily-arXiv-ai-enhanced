Accepted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on E-Health and Bioengineering (EHB); conference proceedings to be indexed/published by Springer Nature", "summary": "The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 gene has been determined as one of the strongest common genetic risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The location of the SNP in a non-coding region suggests a regulatory mechanism, meaning the SNP doesn't change the protein's own structure but rather affects how the TCF7L2 protein binds to DNA to control other genes. This binding, however, is highly dependent on the shape and flexibility of the DNA. This study aims to reveal the atomic-level effects of the SNP's cytosine-to-thymine substitution on the TCF7L2-DNA complex. We first utilized AlphaFold to generate individual high-confidence structures of the TCF7L2 protein and two 15-base pair DNA duplexes: one containing the reference C allele and one containing the variant T allele. These structures were then used as inputs for Neurosnap's Boltz2 deep learning model to generate two complete protein-DNA complexes of the TCF7L2 HMG-box bound to each DNA variant. Using the iMODS server, we conducted a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) to predict and compare large-scale flexibility and differences in interactions between the complexes. The protein-DNA interface was dissected using PDBsum to locate atomic contacts, clefts, and interaction maps. Overall, our results show that the T allele variant exhibits increased global stiffness with a higher eigenvalue and reduced flexibility, suggesting that the SNP disrupts the mechanism and biomechanical balance needed for efficient TCF7L2-DNA binding, thus affecting downstream gene regulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0TCF7L2\u57fa\u56e0\u4e2d\u7684SNP rs7903146\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cdDNA\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u4e86TCF7L2\u86cb\u767d\u4e0eDNA\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0b\u6e38\u57fa\u56e0\u8c03\u63a7\u5931\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793aSNP rs7903146\u4e2d\u80de\u5627\u5576\u5230\u80f8\u817a\u5627\u5576\u7684\u66ff\u6362\u5bf9TCF7L2-DNA\u590d\u5408\u7269\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u57fa\u56e0\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528AlphaFold\u751f\u6210TCF7L2\u86cb\u767d\u548cDNA\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Neurosnap\u7684Boltz2\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u86cb\u767d-DNA\u590d\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NMA\u548cPDBsum\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "result": "T\u7b49\u4f4d\u57fa\u56e0\u53d8\u4f53\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u521a\u5ea6\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660eSNP\u7834\u574f\u4e86TCF7L2-DNA\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "SNP\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u86cb\u767d-DNA\u590d\u5408\u7269\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u57fa\u56e0\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5176\u4e0eT2D\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most current approaches assume a rigid protein binding pocket, neglecting the intrinsic flexibility of proteins and the conformational rearrangements induced by ligand binding, limiting their applicability in practical drug discovery. Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states.

However, designing effective peptide binders is difficult. A typical peptide has an enormous number of possible sequences, and only a few of these will fold into the right 3D shape to match a given protein target. Existing computational methods either generate many candidate sequences without considering how they will fold, or build peptide backbones and then find suitable sequences afterward. Here we introduce ApexGen, a new AI-based framework that simultaneously designs a peptide's amino-acid sequence and its three-dimensional structure to fit a given protein target. For each target, ApexGen produces a full all-atom peptide model in a small number of deterministic integration steps. In tests on hundreds of protein targets, the peptides designed by ApexGen fit tightly onto their target surfaces and cover nearly the entire binding site. These peptides have shapes similar to those found in natural protein-peptide complexes, and they show strong predicted binding affinity in computational experiments. Because ApexGen couples sequence and structure design at every step of Euler integration within a flow-matching sampler, it is much faster and more efficient than prior approaches. This unified method could greatly accelerate the discovery of new peptide-based therapeutics.", "AI": {"tldr": "ApexGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u80bd\u7684\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9776\u6807\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u52a0\u901f\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u80bd\u836f\u7269\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u80bd\u836f\u7269\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u836f\u7269\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e6\u53ca\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4f4d\u70b9\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u5927\u86cb\u767d\u836f\u7269\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u751f\u4ea7\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u80bd\u7ed3\u5408\u5242\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u5408\u6781\u5176\u5e9e\u5927\u3002", "method": "ApexGen\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65Euler\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u80bd\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9776\u6807\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cApexGen\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u591a\u80bd\u7d27\u5bc6\u7ed3\u5408\u9776\u6807\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u51e0\u4e4e\u6574\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\uff0c\u5f62\u72b6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5929\u7136\u86cb\u767d-\u591a\u80bd\u590d\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ApexGen\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u80bd\u7597\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

A few of papers have already investigated its accuracy in predicting different biomolecular structures. However, the potential applications of AF3 beyond basic structure prediction have not been fully explored. In our study, we firstly focused on structure predictions of antibody-antigen (CD47) complexes, which is believed to be challenge for AF3 due to limited resolved cognate crystallographic structures. Furtherly, we aimed to the potentiality of AF3 in performing pre-screening for potent antibody candidates as an auxiliary work through binding affinity analysis compared to other molecular docking modules of commercial software, which would greatly benefit the lead identification or optimization process in the drug development. In essence, this is not limited to antibody-antigen binding affinity, but many other chemical or physical properties of any drug candidate based on AF3's accurate predicting structures that are extremely close to the reality. According to our experimental results, AF3 is a very promising competitor, which can efficiently produce highly reliable molecular structures and subsequent binding energy predictions for most subjects. Surprisingly, an unexpected and nonrandom phenomenon \"reverse docking\" was observed for two of our antibody subjects, suggesting new issues arising from the architectural revolution of AF3. Our analysis and error correction experiments show that this phenomenon is likely to be caused by revolutionized AI model architectures, which provides important experience and reminders for the optimization and design direction of AI for structural prediction.
