Motivation: 传统药物释放模型（如Fick、Higuchi、Peppas）依赖于简化假设，难以准确模拟复杂几何形状和释放机制。本文旨在通过结合物理定律和实验数据，提出一种更精确的预测方法。

Method: 将Fick第二定律嵌入PINN中作为损失函数，使用10,000个拉丁超立方配置点和已有实验数据集，通过MAE和RMSE评估性能，并引入BPINNs进行不确定性量化。

Result: 在所有薄膜类型中，新方法平均误差相对传统基线降低40%。PINN仅使用6%的释放时间数据即达到RMSE <0.05，BPINNs在噪声条件下提供更可靠的不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合物理定律和实验数据，能够从短期测量中精确预测长期释放行为，为加速药物释放系统的早期设计和表征提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of drug release is essential for designing and developing controlled-release systems. Classical models (Fick, Higuchi, Peppas) rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their accuracy in complex geometries and release mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel approach using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Bayesian PINNs (BPINNs) for predicting release from planar, 1D-wrinkled, and 2D-crumpled films. This approach uniquely integrates Fick's diffusion law with limited experimental data to enable accurate long-term predictions from short-term measurements, and is systematically benchmarked against classical drug release models. We embedded Fick's second law into PINN as loss with 10,000 Latin-hypercube collocation points and utilized previously published experimental datasets to assess drug release performance through mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), considering noisy conditions and limited-data scenarios. Our approach reduced mean error by up to 40% relative to classical baselines across all film types. The PINN formulation achieved RMSE <0.05 utilizing only the first 6% of the release time data (reducing 94% of release time required for the experiments) for the planar film. For wrinkled and crumpled films, the PINN reached RMSE <0.05 in 33% of the release time data. BPINNs provide tighter and more reliable uncertainty quantification under noise. By combining physical laws with experimental data, the proposed framework yields highly accurate long-term release predictions from short-term measurements, offering a practical route for accelerated characterization and more efficient early-stage drug release system formulation.
