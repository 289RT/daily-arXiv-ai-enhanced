Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a powerful tool for
studying the structural heterogeneity of proteins and their complexes, offering
insights into macromolecular dynamics directly within cells. Driven by recent
computational advances, including powerful machine learning frameworks,
researchers can now resolve both discrete structural states and continuous
conformational changes from 3D subtomograms and stacks of 2D particle-images
acquired across tilt-series. In this review, we survey recent innovations in
particle classification and heterogeneous 3D reconstruction methods, focusing
specifically on the relative merits of workflows that operate on reconstructed
3D subtomogram volumes compared to those using extracted 2D particle-images. We
additionally highlight how these methods have provided specific biological
insights into the organization, dynamics, and structural variability of
cellular components. Finally, we advocate for the development of benchmarking
datasets collected in vitro and in situ to enable a more objective comparison
of existent and emerging methods for particle classification and heterogeneous
3D reconstruction.

### [2] [Rotational Dynamics of ATP Synthase: Mechanical Constraints and Energy Dissipative Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23439)
*Islam K. Matar,Peyman Fahimi,Cherif F. Matta*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 该论文详细分析了线粒体内膜质子动力（PMF）如何用于ATP合成中的能量转换，发现大部分能量被转化为ATP化学自由能，而剩余部分因摩擦等因素耗散。此外，研究探讨了量子力学对Fo单元旋转的限制，发现其运作仍处于经典范围。

Motivation: 研究旨在量化PMF能量在ATP合成中的分配方式，探索能量耗散的机制，并评估量子效应对酶功能的影响。

Method: 通过定量分析各能量耗散通道（如摩擦、质子泄漏等）的贡献，并引入量子力学理论计算旋转状态的能级和隧穿概率。

Result: 75-83%的PMF能量被高效转化为ATP化学自由能，其余17-25%因摩擦等耗散；量子效应在生理温度下对Fo单元旋转的影响极小。

Conclusion: ATP合成酶在经典物理范围内实现了能量转换的高效优化，量子效应对其功能影响可忽略。

Abstract: The proton motive force (PMF) across the inner mitochondrial membrane
delivers approximately 0.2 eV of energy per proton, powering the FoF1-ATP
synthase molecular motor. Here, we provide a detailed accounting of how this
energy is utilized: Approximately 75-83% is transduced into the chemical free
energy of ATP synthesis, while the remaining 17-25% is dissipated through
internal friction, viscous drag, proton leakage, electroviscous effects,
elastic deformations, and information-theoretic costs. Each dissipation channel
is quantitatively evaluated, revealing that internal friction in the F1 motor
is the dominant loss mechanism. In this work, we did not account for the energy
supplied/injected due to the intrinsic electrostatic potential of the enzyme
itself. In addition to this energy bookkeeping, we also examine the quantum
mechanical constraints on the Fo unit's rotation. We find that, as can be
expected, the energy spacing between quantized rotational states is several
orders of magnitude smaller than thermal energies at physiological temperature,
and that the tunneling probability through rotational barriers practically
totally non-existent. Furthermore, the biological rotation speed (100-650
revolutions per second (rps)) is between one and three orders of magnitude
below the quantum limit implied by quantization of angular momentum of the
c-ring (which would have been ca. 13,000 to 62,000 rps (depending on the size
of the c-ring (17 to 8 subunits, respectively)) in the first rotational energy
level of the c-ring). Nevertheless, experimental estimates of the rotation
rates in isolated c-ring suggest rates in the vicinity of 43,000 rps, right
within our theoretical quantum estimates. However, ATP synthase as a whole
operates firmly within the classical regime, despite its nanoscale dimensions,
and highlight its evolutionary optimization for robust and efficient energy
conversion....
