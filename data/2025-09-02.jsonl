Tandem mass spectrometry (MS$^2$) is the major analytical\ntechnique in proteomics that identifies peptides by ionizing them, fragmenting\nthem, and using the resulting mass spectra to identify and quantify proteins in\nbiological samples. In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability\nprediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide\nidentification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information.\nCurrent approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes\nthat a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides. Nevertheless,\nthis assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view\nand limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the\nfirst comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific\nfragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion\nprobability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair\nof peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million\nhigh-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide\nassignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance\nusing simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models\nleveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous\nmethods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance\nacross benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the\npeptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring\nsophisticated machine learning approaches."}

The\ncanonical FAD-tryptophan radical pair exhibits pronounced anisotropic hyperfine\ncouplings, enabling sensitivity to geomagnetic fields. However, maintaining\nspin coherence under physiological conditions and explaining responses to weak\nradiofrequency fields remain unresolved challenges. Alternative radicals, such\nas superoxide and ascorbate, have been proposed to enhance anisotropy or\nsuppress decoherence. This review summarizes the quantum basis of\nmagnetoreception, evaluates both canonical and alternative radical pair models,\nand discusses amplification strategies including triads, spin scavenging, and\nbystander radicals. Emphasis is placed on how molecular geometry, exchange and\ndipolar interactions, and hyperfine topology modulate magnetic sensitivity. Key\nopen questions and future directions are outlined, highlighting the need for\nstructural and dynamical data under physiological conditions."}

Traditional antibody discovery pipelines require\n10-12 months, limiting their applicability for rapid outbreak response. This\nproject introduces ImmunoAI, a machine learning framework that accelerates\nantibody discovery by predicting high-affinity candidates using\ngradient-boosted models trained on thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D\ntopological interface descriptors. A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes\nwas curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM\nregressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The\nmodel reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on\n117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from\n1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2\nvariant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model\nidentified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting\nkey mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for\nexperimental testing. In summary, ImmunoAI shortens design cycles and enables\nfaster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks."}
