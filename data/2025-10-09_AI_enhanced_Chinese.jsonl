Building on this\nperspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two\ncomplementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from\nretrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints\ndistilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure\nrepresentations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding\ncalibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational\nassays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve\nstate-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the\ntraining data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm\nthat within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving\nrobustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths.
