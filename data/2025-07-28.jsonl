Accurately predicting the specific mechanisms underlying DDIs\n(named DDI events or DDIEs) is critical for the safe clinical use of drugs.\nDDIEs are typically represented as textual descriptions. However, most\ncomputational methods focus more on predicting the DDIE class label over\ngenerating human-readable natural language increasing clinicians'\ninterpretation costs. Furthermore, current methods overlook the fact that each\ndrug assumes distinct biological functions in a DDI, which, when used as input\ncontext, can enhance the understanding of the DDIE process and benefit DDIE\ngeneration by the language model (LM). In this work, we propose a novel\npairwise knowledge-augmented generative method (termed PKAG-DDI) for DDIE text\ngeneration. It consists of a pairwise knowledge selector efficiently injecting\nstructural information between drugs bidirectionally and simultaneously to\nselect pairwise biological functions from the knowledge set, and a pairwise\nknowledge integration strategy that matches and integrates the selected\nbiological functions into the LM. Experiments on two professional datasets show\nthat PKAG-DDI outperforms existing methods in DDIE text generation, especially\nin challenging inductive scenarios, indicating its practicality and\ngeneralization."}

Nelson contributed to this work as\n  advisors to Latent Labs. Michael Flashman contributed to this work while at\n  Latent Labs", "summary": "Traditional drug discovery relies on rounds of screening millions of\ncandidate molecules with low success rates, making drug discovery time and\nresource intensive. To overcome this screening bottleneck, we introduce\nLatent-X, an all-atom protein design model that enables a new paradigm of\nprecision AI design. Given a target protein epitope, Latent-X jointly generates\nthe all atom structure and sequence of the protein binder and target, directly\nmodelling the non-covalent interactions essential for specific binding. We\ndemonstrate its efficacy across two therapeutically relevant modalities through\nextensive wet lab experiments, testing as few as 30-100 designs per target. For\nmacrocyclic peptides, Latent-X achieves experimental hit rates exceeding 90% on\nall evaluated benchmark targets. For mini-binders, it consistently produces\npotent candidates against all evaluated benchmark targets, with binding\naffinities reaching the low nanomolar and picomolar range - comparable to those\nof approved therapeutics - whilst also being highly specific in mammalian\ndisplay. In direct comparisons with the state-of-the-art models AlphaProteo,\nRFdiffusion and RFpeptides under identical conditions demonstrates, Latent-X\ngenerates binders with higher hit rates and better binding affinities, and\nuniquely creates structurally diverse binders, including complex beta-sheet\nfolds. Its end-to-end process is an order of magnitude faster than existing\nmulti-step computational pipelines. By drastically improving the efficiency and\nsuccess rate of de novo design, Latent-X represents a significant advance\ntowards push-button biologics discovery and a valuable tool for protein\nengineers. Latent-X is available at https://platform.latentlabs.com, enabling\nusers to reliably generate de novo binders without AI infrastructure or coding."}
