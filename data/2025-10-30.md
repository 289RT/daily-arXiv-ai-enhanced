Motivation: 当前生成蛋白质骨架的技术（如Diffusion和Flow Matching）计算成本高，亟需一种高效方法以减少NFEs。

Method: 应用ReFlow技术改进预训练的SE(3) flow matching模型，并系统研究其在蛋白质生成中的设计选择（如数据整理、训练和推理设置）。

Result: 研究发现ReFlow在蛋白质领域对耦合生成和退火的选择敏感，且图像领域的优化方法不直接适用于蛋白质。

Conclusion: 通过改进ReFlow方法，论文为蛋白质骨架生成提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: Generative modeling techniques such as Diffusion and Flow Matching have
achieved significant successes in generating designable and diverse protein
backbones. However, many current models are computationally expensive,
requiring hundreds or even thousands of function evaluations (NFEs) to yield
samples of acceptable quality, which can become a bottleneck in practical
design campaigns that often generate $10^4\ -\ 10^6$ designs per target. In
image generation, Rectified Flows (ReFlow) can significantly reduce the
required NFEs for a given target quality, but their application in protein
backbone generation has been less studied. We apply ReFlow to improve the low
NFE performance of pretrained SE(3) flow matching models for protein backbone
generation and systematically study ReFlow design choices in the context of
protein generation in data curation, training and inference time settings. In
particular, we (1) show that ReFlow in the protein domain is particularly
sensitive to the choice of coupling generation and annealing, (2) demonstrate
how useful design choices for ReFlow in the image domain do not directly
translate to better performance on proteins, and (3) make improvements to
ReFlow methodology for proteins.

Abstract: Designing enzyme backbones with substrate-specific functionality is a
critical challenge in computational protein engineering. Current generative
models excel in protein design but face limitations in binding data,
substrate-specific control, and flexibility for de novo enzyme backbone
generation. To address this, we introduce EnzyBind, a dataset with 11,100
experimentally validated enzyme-substrate pairs specifically curated from
PDBbind. Building on this, we propose EnzyControl, a method that enables
functional and substrate-specific control in enzyme backbone generation. Our
approach generates enzyme backbones conditioned on MSA-annotated catalytic
sites and their corresponding substrates, which are automatically extracted
from curated enzyme-substrate data. At the core of EnzyControl is EnzyAdapter,
a lightweight, modular component integrated into a pretrained motif-scaffolding
model, allowing it to become substrate-aware. A two-stage training paradigm
further refines the model's ability to generate accurate and functional enzyme
structures. Experiments show that our EnzyControl achieves the best performance
across structural and functional metrics on EnzyBind and EnzyBench benchmarks,
with particularly notable improvements of 13\% in designability and 13\% in
catalytic efficiency compared to the baseline models. The code is released at
https://github.com/Vecteur-libre/EnzyControl.
