### [1] [Protein aggregation in Huntington's disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04174)
*Guylaine Hoffner,Philippe Djian*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 摘要讨论了亨廷顿蛋白中多聚谷氨酰胺扩展导致的蛋白聚集及其稳定机制，探讨了氢键和共价键的作用，并指出其在治疗策略中的重要性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究亨廷顿病的蛋白聚集机制，以确定稳定聚集物的化学键类型，为治疗策略提供依据。

Method: 通过细胞培养模型分析蛋白聚集的稳定机制，推测氢键和共价键的作用。

Result: 细胞模型中蛋白聚集主要由氢键稳定，但共价键也可能参与；患者脑内聚集物的稳定机制尚不清楚。

Conclusion: 明确稳定蛋白聚集的键类型对亨廷顿病的治疗策略至关重要。

Abstract: The presence of an expanded polyglutamine produces a toxic gain of function
in huntingtin. Protein aggregation resulting from this gain of function is
likely to be the cause of neuronal death. Two main mechanisms of aggregation
have been proposed: hydrogen bonding by polar-zipper formation and covalent
bonding by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. In cell culture models of
Huntington's disease, aggregates are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but
covalent bonds are also likely to occur. Nothing is known about the nature of
the bonds that stabilize the aggregates in the brain of patients with
Huntington's disease. It seems that the nature of the bond stabilizing the
aggregates is one of the most important questions, as the answer would
condition the therapeutic approach to Huntington's disease.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态蛋白质功能预测方法DSRPGO，通过动态选择和重建预训练机制，解决了多模态特征复杂互联和解码的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态蛋白质特征在功能预测中至关重要，但其信息广泛且复杂，难以解码。

Method: 采用重建预训练挖掘细粒度信息，并设计双向交互模块（BInM）促进多模态特征交互学习；针对分层多标签分类问题，设计了动态选择模块（DSM）。

Result: DSRPGO模型在人类数据集的BPO、MFO和CCO上表现显著优于其他基准模型。

Conclusion: DSRPGO通过创新机制有效提升了蛋白质功能预测的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function
prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information,
ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and
interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex
interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function
prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive
pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce
reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low
semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module
(BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features.
Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label
classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to
select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein
function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO,
MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.
