Advances in computational approaches to PPI prediction have\nclosely followed progress in deep learning and natural language processing. In\nthis review, we outline the state-of the-art for sequence-based PPI prediction\nmethods and explore their impact on target identification and drug discovery.\nWe begin with an overview of commonly used training data sources and techniques\nused to curate these data to enhance the quality of the training set.\nSubsequently, we survey various PPI predictor types, including traditional\nsimilarity-based approaches, and deep learning-based approaches with a\nparticular emphasis on the transformer architecture. Finally, we provide\nexamples of PPI prediction in systems-level proteomics analyses, target\nidentification, and design of therapeutic peptides and antibodies. We also take\nthe opportunity to showcase the potential of PPI-aware drug discovery models in\naccelerating therapeutic development."}

The method discretizes\nthe binding site into a grid and solves a QUBO problem to select spatially\ndistributed, energetically favorable grid points. Each ligand is represented by\na three-atom geometric contour, which is aligned to the selected grid points\nthrough rigid-body transformation, producing from hundreds to hundreds of\nthousands of candidate poses. Using a benchmark of 169 protein-ligand\ncomplexes, we generated an average of 110 to 600000 poses per ligand, depending\non QUBO parameters and matching thresholds. Evaluation against crystallographic\nstructures revealed that a larger number of candidates increases the likelihood\nof recovering near-native poses, with recovery rates reaching 100 percent for\nroot mean square deviation (RMSD) values below 1.0 angstrom and 95.9 percent\nfor RMSD values below 0.6 angstrom. Since the correct binding pose is not known\nin advance, we apply AutoDock-based scoring to select the most plausible\ncandidates from the generated pool, achieving recovery rates of up to 82.8\npercent for RMSD < 2.0 angstrom, 81.7 percent for RMSD < 1.5 angstrom, and 75.2\npercent for RMSD < 1.0 angstrom. When poses with misleading scores are\nexcluded, performance improves further, with recovery rates reaching up to 97.8\npercent for RMSD < 2.0 angstrom and 1.5 angstrom, and 95.4 percent for RMSD <\n1.0 angstrom. This modular and hardware-flexible framework offers a scalable\nsolution for pre-filtering ligands and generating high-quality binding poses\nbefore affinity prediction, making it well-suited for large-scale virtual\nscreening pipelines."}

Experimental determination of\nthermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover,\nexisting computational approaches are often hindered by limited data\navailability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model\ndevelopment and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this\ndataset, we present the \\textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning\nframework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature\nstability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of\n24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33,\nrespectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating\nsegment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that\ndifferent regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal\nbehavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide\nthe engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a\n1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved\nthrough only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function."}

However, their application to structure-based drug\ndesign (SBDD) remains limited due to critical data constraints. To address the\nlimitation of training data for models targeting SBDD tasks, we propose an\nevolutionary framework named MEVO, which bridges the gap between billion-scale\nsmall molecule dataset and the scarce protein-ligand complex dataset, and\neffectively increase the abundance of training data for generative SBDD models.\nMEVO is composed of three key components: a high-fidelity VQ-VAE for molecule\nrepresentation in latent space, a diffusion model for pharmacophore-guided\nmolecule generation, and a pocket-aware evolutionary strategy for molecule\noptimization with physics-based scoring function. This framework efficiently\ngenerate high-affinity binders for various protein targets, validated with\npredicted binding affinities using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. In\naddition, we showcase the capability of MEVO in designing potent inhibitors to\nKRAS$^{\\textrm{G12D}}$, a challenging target in cancer therapeutics, with\nsimilar affinity to the known highly active inhibitor evaluated by FEP\ncalculations. With high versatility and generalizability, MEVO offers an\neffective and data-efficient model for various tasks in structure-based ligand\ndesign."}

Experimental methods for DBP\nidentification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient\ncomputational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder\nwith a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly\nfrom raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions\nwithin residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich\nsequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture\nhierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We\nconducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings\nfrom ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that\nProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large\ndatasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller\ndatasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive\nevaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It\nachieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On\nindependent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2%\nand 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as\nPDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and\nspecificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and\ngeneralizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced\ndeep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse\ngenomic contexts."}
