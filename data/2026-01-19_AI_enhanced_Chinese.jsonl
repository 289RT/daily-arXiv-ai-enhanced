The results show that the RF irradiation preserves the activity of treated samples of this enzyme with respect to a non-treated sample that instead suffer an increased rate of activity loss.

A central open question is how client recruitment feeds back on scaffold interactions to determine condensate composition. Here we address this problem in a reconstituted focal adhesion system composed of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphorylated p130Cas (Cas) as scaffolds and the adaptor protein paxillin (PXN) as a client. We show that both FAK phosphorylation and PXN recruitment produce a common compositional response in which FAK becomes enriched while Cas is depleted within the condensate. To interpret these observations, we develop two complementary theoretical descriptions. First, within a two-component Flory-Huggins framework, we show that phosphorylation can be captured by either strengthening heterotypic FAK-Cas interactions or increasing the effective number of interaction-relevant segments on FAK, both of which bias partitioning toward FAK-rich condensates. Second, we introduce a minimal three-component Flory-Huggins theory without an explicit solvent and map it onto an effective two-component description, demonstrating that client recruitment renormalizes homotypic and heterotypic scaffold interactions. Analytical predictions for the location of the critical point are tested in reconstituted multicomponent systems through PXN addition, showing that client recruitment alone tunes proximity to criticality and reshapes condensate composition. Together, our results reveal distinct yet convergent physical routes by which post-translational modification and client recruitment control scaffold composition in multicomponent condensates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cFAK\u78f7\u9178\u5316\u548cPXN\u62db\u52df\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u8d8b\u540c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9014\u5f84\u8c03\u63a7\u591a\u7ec4\u5206\u51dd\u805a\u7269\u7684\u652f\u67b6\u7ec4\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u62db\u52df\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u9988\u652f\u67b6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u51b3\u5b9a\u51dd\u805a\u7269\u7ec4\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u6784\u7684FAK-Cas-PXN\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08\u53cc\u7ec4\u5206Flory-Huggins\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u4e09\u7ec4\u5206\u7406\u8bba\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u78f7\u9178\u5316\u548cPXN\u62db\u52df\u4f1a\u504f\u5411FAK\u5bcc\u96c6\u7684\u51dd\u805a\u7269\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ffb\u8bd1\u540e\u4fee\u9970\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u62db\u52df\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5171\u540c\u8c03\u63a7\u591a\u7ec4\u5206\u51dd\u805a\u7269\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u3002"}}

Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes. Internal spherules that are themselves growth-competent are produced within the protocells, establishing a rudimentary mode of self-perpetuation. The chemical dynamics we observe in controlled laboratory conditions also occur in reaction mixtures exposed to natural day-night cycles. Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u539f\u6599\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u539f\u578b\u7ec6\u80de\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ee3\u8c22\u548c\u751f\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u751f\u547d\u6837\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4ece\u65e0\u5e8f\u5316\u5b66\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u5230\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u539f\u578b\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u8d28\u5230\u751f\u547d\u6837\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u542b\u78f7\u3001\u94c1\u3001\u94bc\u76d0\u548c\u7532\u919b\u7684\u5747\u8d28\u6c34\u6eb6\u6db2\u6df7\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5176\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u539f\u578b\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u751f\u957f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u6eb6\u6db2\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u5316\u5b66\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u751f\u957f\u7684\u539f\u578b\u7ec6\u80de\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u81ea\u7136\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u94bc\u5bcc\u96c6\u5fae\u7403\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u7ec4\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u751f\u547d\u6837\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u754c\u4e2d\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}
