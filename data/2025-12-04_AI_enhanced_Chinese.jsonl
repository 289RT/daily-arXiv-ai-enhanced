We present ConforMix, an inference-time algorithm that enhances sampling of conformational distributions using a combination of classifier guidance, filtering, and free energy estimation. Our approach upgrades diffusion models -- whether trained for static structure prediction or conformational generation -- to enable more efficient discovery of conformational variability without requiring prior knowledge of major degrees of freedom. ConforMix is orthogonal to improvements in model pretraining and would benefit even a hypothetical model that perfectly reproduced the Boltzmann distribution. Remarkably, when applied to a diffusion model trained for static structure prediction, ConforMix captures structural changes including domain motion, cryptic pocket flexibility, and transporter cycling, while avoiding unphysical states. Case studies of biologically critical proteins demonstrate the scalability, accuracy, and utility of this method.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConforMix\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u3001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u6784\u8c61\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u5982\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6784\u8c61\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9a8c\u786e\u5b9a\u6784\u8c61\u5206\u5e03\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u6298\u53e0\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "ConforMix\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u3001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5347\u7ea7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u6784\u8c61\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "result": "ConforMix\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5982\u57df\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u8f6c\u8fd0\u86cb\u767d\u5faa\u73af\uff09\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u975e\u7269\u7406\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u86cb\u767d\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "ConforMix\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u4e86\u89e3\u4e3b\u8981\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002"}}
