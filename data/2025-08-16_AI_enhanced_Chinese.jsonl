IBEX retains the\noriginal TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate\nmolecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS\noptimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five\nphysics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of\nfreedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the\nzero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to\n64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal\nmol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus\n3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves\nstate-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation\nerror.", "AI": {"tldr": "IBEX\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e09\u7ef4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528PAC-Bayesian\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u7406\u8bba\u91cf\u5316\u6837\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Scaffold Hopping\u4efb\u52a1\u548cL-BFGS\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "IBEX\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u63a5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001Vina\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "IBEX\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
