Firstly, to assess whether a universal principle could govern the process of protein folding. Secondly, to clarify whether the folding of a protein could be characterized by an effective trajectory, as determined by the principle of least action, while concurrently addressing the Levinthal Paradox. The effective-trajectory conjecture, which is compatible with the existence of multiple folding pathways and characterized by a single folding rate, addresses the search timescale paradox by explaining how a protein in a proper environment always reaches its native state at a consistent folding rate and in a biologically reasonable time frame (as determined by the thermodynamic hypothesis, or Anfinsen dogma). The preliminary findings support the hypothesis that the protein folding process is governed by a universal principle: that of least action. From this viewpoint, it should be regarded as a fundamental physical model that not only facilitates the identification of folding pathways and trajectories but also offers a physical framework for understanding how nature may link the optimal kinetic speed of the protein folding process with its higher thermodynamic stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6298\u53e0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u5426\u53d7\u5355\u4e00\u666e\u9002\u539f\u7406\uff08\u6700\u5c0f\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u539f\u7406\uff09\u652f\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8f68\u8ff9\u731c\u60f3\u6765\u89e3\u51b3Levinthal\u6096\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6298\u53e0\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u539f\u7406\u63cf\u8ff0\u6298\u53e0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3Levinthal\u6096\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u8f68\u8ff9\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6298\u53e0\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u6298\u53e0\u901f\u7387\u7684\u591a\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8fbe\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6298\u53e0\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u6700\u5c0f\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u539f\u7406\u652f\u914d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6298\u53e0\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u5c0f\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u539f\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6298\u53e0\u7684\u666e\u9002\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent inverse folding models, trained to reconstruct sequences from structure, have had considerable impact in identifying functional mutations. However, current approaches are constrained to designing sequences composed exclusively of natural amino acids (NAAs). The larger set of non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs), which offer greater chemical diversity, and are frequently used in in-vivo protein engineering, remain largely inaccessible for current variant effect prediction methods.\n  To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{UNAAGI}, a diffusion-based generative model that reconstructs residue identities from atomic-level structure using an E(3)-equivariant framework. By modeling side chains in full atomic detail rather than as discrete tokens, UNAAGI enables the exploration of both canonical and non-canonical amino acid substitutions within a unified generative paradigm. We evaluate our method on experimentally benchmarked mutation effect datasets and demonstrate that it achieves substantially improved performance on NCAA substitutions compared to the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our results suggest a shared methodological foundation between protein engineering and structure-based drug design, opening the door for a unified training framework across these domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "UNAAGI\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u5efa\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u7136\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUNAAGI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528E(3)-\u7b49\u53d8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u7ec6\u8282\u5efa\u6a21\u4fa7\u94fe\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u66ff\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cUNAAGI\u5728\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u66ff\u6362\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "UNAAGI\u4e3a\u86cb\u767d\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}
