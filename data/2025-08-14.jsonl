A subclass of this problem, the Discretizable Distance\nGeometry Problem (DDGP), allows a recursive solution via the combinatorial\nBranch-and-Prune (BP) algorithm by exploiting specific vertex orderings in\nprotein backbones. To accommodate the inherent uncertainty in NMR data, the\ninterval Branch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}BP) algorithm was introduced,\nincorporating interval distance constraints through uniform sampling. In this\nwork, we propose two new algorithmic frameworks for solving the\nthree-dimensional interval DDGP (\\textit{i}DDGP): the interval Angular\nBranch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}ABP), and its extension, the interval Torsion-angle\nBranch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}TBP). These methods convert interval distances into\nangular constraints, enabling structured sampling over circular arcs. The\n\\textit{i}ABP method guarantees feasibility by construction and removes the\nneed for explicit constraint checking. The \\textit{i}TBP algorithm further\nincorporates known torsion angle intervals, enforcing local chirality and\nplanarity conditions critical for protein geometry. We present formal\nmathematical foundations for both methods and a systematic strategy for\ngenerating biologically meaningful \\textit{i}DDGP instances from the Protein\nData Bank (PDB) structures. Computational experiments demonstrate that both\n\\textit{i}ABP and \\textit{i}TBP consistently outperform \\textit{i}BP in terms\nof solution rate and computational efficiency. In particular, \\textit{i}TBP\nyields solutions with lower RMSD variance relative to the original PDB\nstructures, better reflecting biologically plausible conformations."}
