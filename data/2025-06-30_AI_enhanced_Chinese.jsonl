Upon maturation, core-1, comprising of the 57 residues (39-95) in\nthe N-terminus become structured, resulting in the formation of a\nnon-polymorphic fibril. The truncated FUS-LC-C (residues 110-214) construct\nforms a fibril in which core-2 (residues 112-150) adopts a $\\beta$-sheet\nstructure. Using coarse-grained monomer SOP-IDP model simulations of FUS-LC, we\npredict that residues 155-190 in the C-terminal (core-3) form rapidly, followed\nby core-2, and finally core-1. The time scale of formation of the cores and\ntheir stabilities are inversely correlated, as anticipated by the Ostwald's\nrule of stages. Unbiased multichain simulations show that the chemical\npotentials in the two phases are equal and the calculated densities of the\ndense and dilute phases are in agreement with experiments. The dense phase,\nwhich forms by a nucleation mechanism, coarsens over time by a process that is\nreminiscent of Ostwald ripening. AlphaFold predictions of the core-3 structure\nand the simulations show that $\\beta$-strand emerges in the core-3 region early\nduring the droplet formation, and drives the initiation of FUS-LC assembly. The\ntechniques introduced here are general and could be used to probe assembly of\nother IDPs such as TDP-43, which shares many features with FUS-LC.", "AI": {"tldr": "FUS-LC\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5206\u79bb\u5f62\u6210\u81f4\u5bc6\u6db2\u4f53\u72b6\u76f8\uff0c\u9010\u6e10\u6210\u719f\u4e3a\u6709\u5e8f\u51dd\u80f6\u72b6\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u9075\u5faa\u5965\u65af\u7279\u74e6\u5c14\u5fb7\u9636\u6bb5\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76FUS-LC\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5206\u79bb\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6IDP\uff08\u5982TDP-43\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5355\u4f53SOP-IDP\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62dfFUS-LC\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408AlphaFold\u9884\u6d4b\u6838\u5fc3\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u6838\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u987a\u5e8f\u4e3acore-3\u3001core-2\u3001core-1\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u5965\u65af\u7279\u74e6\u5c14\u5fb7\u9636\u6bb5\u89c4\u5219\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6838\u5fc3-3\u533a\u7684\u03b2-\u7247\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u9a71\u52a8FUS-LC\u7ec4\u88c5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4ed6IDP\uff08\u5982TDP-43\uff09\u7684\u7ec4\u88c5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86FUS-LC\u76f8\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u70b9\u3002"}}
