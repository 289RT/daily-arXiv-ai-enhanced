  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统建筑材料在极地等恶劣环境下效果不佳且资源稀缺，因此需要开发一种可持续、可生物降解的替代材料。

Method: 通过将AFPIII（冰结合蛋白）与CBM3a（CNC结合蛋白）连接，设计嵌合蛋白，使CNC在冷冻过程中自组织形成增强网络。

Result: BioPykrete避免了冰的脆性和突然破坏，表现出弹性响应，抗压强度与混凝土相当。

Conclusion: 嵌合蛋白的工程设计可在复合材料中推广应用，为其他材料性能的定制和改进提供可能性。

Abstract: This work presents BioPykrete, a new sustainable bio-composite material
created from ice, nano-crystalline cellulose (CNC), and a tailor-made chimera
protein designed to bind the two together. We developed and produced the
chimera protein by linking AFPIII, an ice-binding protein, with CBM3a, a
CNC-binding protein. As the suspension freezes, the CNC chains self-organize
into a reinforcing network between the ice crystals. This structural
enhancement limits crack propagation to typical pore sizes, allowing BioPykrete
to avoid the brittle and sudden failure commonly associated with ice. Instead,
it exhibits an elastic-like response to stress, making it suitable for
construction and engineering applications. With compressive strength comparable
with concrete, BioPykrete offers a sustainable and biodegradable alternative to
construction materials suitable for the harsh arctic regions of the world where
traditional methods are ineffective, and resources are scarce. Engineering
chimera proteins with specific affinity to more than a single material type may
help improve or tailor the properties of other composite materials.
