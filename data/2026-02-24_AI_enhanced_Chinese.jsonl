Conventional physics-based energy functions are often computationally expensive, limiting their utility in large-scale screening. In contrast, deep learning-based scoring models offer improved computational efficiency but frequently suffer from limited cross-target generalization and poor interpretability, which restrict their practical applicability. Here we present BioLM-Score, a simple yet generalizable protein-ligand scoring model that couples geometric modeling with representation learning. Specifically, it employs modality-specific and structure-aware encoders for proteins and ligands, each augmented with biomolecular language models to enrich structural and chemical representations. Subsequently, these representations are integrated through a mixture density network to predict multimodal interatomic distance distributions, from which statistically grounded likelihood-based scores are derived. Evaluations on the CASF-2016 benchmark demonstrate that BioLM-Score achieves significant improvements across docking, scoring, ranking, and screening tasks. Moreover, the proposed scoring function serves as an effective optimization objective for guiding docking protocols and conformational search. In summary, BioLM-Score provides a principled and practical alternative to existing scoring functions, combining efficiency, generalization, and interpretability for structure-based drug discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "BioLM-Score\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u8bc4\u5206\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u548c\u914d\u4f53\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728CASF-2016\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBioLM-Score\u5728\u5bf9\u63a5\u3001\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u7b5b\u9009\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "BioLM-Score\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Code available at: https://github.com/jlramirezcolon/hlg-life-detection. AGPLv3 License", "summary": "Amino acids (AAs) are a key target in the search for life beyond Earth due to their extensive role in the machinery of all known life, persistence over geologic timescales, and analytical detectability. However, AAs can also arise from abiotic processes on planets and in space. For example, material from asteroid Bennu contained 33 AAs, including 15 of the 20 proteinogenic AAs that are fundamental to life's functions. Distinguishing life from non-life based on AAs in a sample remains an unsolved problem, particularly when their isotopic and structural signatures (e.g., chirality) could be altered via physicochemical processes. Here we introduce LUMOS (Life Unveiled via Molecular Orbital Signatures), a statistical framework that distinguishes life from non-life by analyzing the distribution of abundance-weighted HOMO-LUMO gap (HLG) values of AAs within a sample. Compilation of AAs datasets from diverse environments and provenances revealed that abiotic samples display highly uniform distributions of AAs HLGs. In contrast, biotic samples show greater variance and preference towards AAs with lower HLG, likely reflecting the need for life to control when, where, and how chemical reactions occur. LUMOS achieves >95% accuracy in distinguishing biotic versus abiotic provenance across diverse environmental and extraterrestrial conditions. These results suggest that varied molecular reactivity within biochemical systems may be a universal feature of life, representing an agnostic biosignature unlinked to the specific set of AAs used by life as we know it. LUMOS is compatible with existing analytical instrumentation, applicable to returned samples or in situ analyses. Broader characterization of abiotic and biotic environments will further refine the chemical boundaries separating biotic from abiotic chemical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "LUMOS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u6837\u672c\u4e2dHOMO-LUMO\u80fd\u9699\uff08HLG\uff09\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u751f\u547d\u4e0e\u975e\u751f\u547d\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc795%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\uff08AAs\uff09\u662f\u5730\u5916\u751f\u547d\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5173\u952e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u751f\u7269\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ea7\u751f\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u533a\u5206\u751f\u547d\u4e0e\u975e\u751f\u547d\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "LUMOS\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u6837\u672c\u4e2dHLG\u503c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u533a\u5206\u751f\u547d\u4e0e\u975e\u751f\u547d\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u6837\u672cHLG\u503c\u65b9\u5dee\u66f4\u5927\u4e14\u504f\u597d\u8f83\u4f4eHLG\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "LUMOS\u5728\u591a\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5730\u5916\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u533a\u5206\u751f\u547d\u4e0e\u975e\u751f\u547d\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc795%\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u751f\u547d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "LUMOS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\u4eea\u5668\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u901a\u7528\u751f\u7269\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u73af\u5883\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u533a\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}
