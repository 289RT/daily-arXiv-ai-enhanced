Abstract: Comprehending the long-timescale dynamics of protein-ligand complexes is very
important for drug discovery and structural biology, but it continues to be
computationally challenging for large biomolecular systems. We introduce
HemePLM-Diffuse, an innovative generative transformer model that is designed
for accurate simulation of protein-ligand trajectories, inpaints the missing
ligand fragments, and sample transition paths in systems with more than 10,000
atoms. HemePLM-Diffuse has features of SE(3)-Invariant tokenization approach
for proteins and ligands, that utilizes time-aware cross-attentional diffusion
to effectively capture atomic motion. We also demonstrate its capabilities
using the 3CQV HEME system, showing enhanced accuracy and scalability compared
to leading models such as TorchMD-Net, MDGEN, and Uni-Mol.

### [2] [Boltzina: Efficient and Accurate Virtual Screening via Docking-Guided Binding Prediction with Boltz-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17555)
*Kairi Furui,Masahito Ohue*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: Boltzina是一个新型框架，结合了Boltz-2的高精度预测和AutoDock Vina的高效性，显著提高了计算效率并保持了较高的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Boltz-2虽然预测精度高，但计算效率低，难以用于大规模化合物筛选。Boltzina旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过省略Boltz-2中的结构预测步骤，直接从AutoDock Vina的对接构象预测亲和力，并优化多构象选择策略和两阶段筛选方法。

Result: Boltzina在MF-PCBA数据集的8个实验中表现优于AutoDock Vina和GNINA，计算速度提升了11.8倍。

Conclusion: Boltzina首次实现了Boltz-2的高精度预测在实际规模筛选中的应用，为计算生物学提供了兼具精度和效率的解决方案。

Abstract: In structure-based drug discovery, virtual screening using conventional
molecular docking methods can be performed rapidly but suffers from limitations
in prediction accuracy. Recently, Boltz-2 was proposed, achieving extremely
high accuracy in binding affinity prediction, but requiring approximately 20
seconds per compound per GPU, making it difficult to apply to large-scale
screening of hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds. This study
proposes Boltzina, a novel framework that leverages Boltz-2's high accuracy
while significantly improving computational efficiency. Boltzina achieves both
accuracy and speed by omitting the rate-limiting structure prediction from
Boltz-2's architecture and directly predicting affinity from AutoDock Vina
docking poses. We evaluate on eight assays from the MF-PCBA dataset and show
that while Boltzina performs below Boltz-2, it provides significantly higher
screening performance compared to AutoDock Vina and GNINA. Additionally,
Boltzina achieved up to 11.8$\times$ faster through reduced recycling
iterations and batch processing. Furthermore, we investigated multi-pose
selection strategies and two-stage screening combining Boltzina and Boltz-2,
presenting optimization methods for accuracy and efficiency according to
application requirements. This study represents the first attempt to apply
Boltz-2's high-accuracy predictions to practical-scale screening, offering a
pipeline that combines both accuracy and efficiency in computational biology.

### [3] [Flexibility-Conditioned Protein Structure Design with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18211)

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架FliPS，用于生成具有目标灵活性的蛋白质骨架，结合了BackFlip网络进行灵活性预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质生成方法仅限于静态目标特性，如基序和对称性，而灵活性对关键功能至关重要。本文旨在克服这一限制。

Method: 利用BackFlip神经网络预测残基灵活性，并结合SE(3)-等变的FliPS模型生成目标灵活性的蛋白质骨架。

Result: 实验证明FliPS能生成多样且具有目标灵活性的蛋白质骨架，并通过分子动力学模拟验证。

Conclusion: FliPS和BackFlip为蛋白质设计提供了灵活性控制的创新工具，促进了蛋白质功能研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in geometric deep learning and generative modeling have
enabled the design of novel proteins with a wide range of desired properties.
However, current state-of-the-art approaches are typically restricted to
generating proteins with only static target properties, such as motifs and
symmetries. In this work, we take a step towards overcoming this limitation by
proposing a framework to condition structure generation on flexibility, which
is crucial for key functionalities such as catalysis or molecular recognition.
We first introduce BackFlip, an equivariant neural network for predicting
per-residue flexibility from an input backbone structure. Relying on BackFlip,
we propose FliPS, an SE(3)-equivariant conditional flow matching model that
solves the inverse problem, that is, generating backbones that display a target
flexibility profile. In our experiments, we show that FliPS is able to generate
novel and diverse protein backbones with the desired flexibility, verified by
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. FliPS and BackFlip are available at
https://github.com/graeter-group/flips .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够整合多种技术并提升药物设计效率的模型，同时具备不确定性估计和偏好对齐能力。

Method: DrugFlow 结合连续流匹配和离散马尔可夫桥，引入不确定性估计和联合偏好对齐方案，并扩展至蛋白构象探索。

Result: 模型在三维数据学习中表现出色，并能检测分布外样本，同时通过偏好对齐优化采样过程。

Conclusion: DrugFlow 提供了高效的药物设计工具，具备多功能性和扩展性，适用于复杂的蛋白-配体交互建模。

Abstract: We introduce DrugFlow, a generative model for structure-based drug design
that integrates continuous flow matching with discrete Markov bridges,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in learning chemical, geometric, and
physical aspects of three-dimensional protein-ligand data. We endow DrugFlow
with an uncertainty estimate that is able to detect out-of-distribution
samples. To further enhance the sampling process towards distribution regions
with desirable metric values, we propose a joint preference alignment scheme
applicable to both flow matching and Markov bridge frameworks. Furthermore, we
extend our model to also explore the conformational landscape of the protein by
jointly sampling side chain angles and molecules.

### [5] [One pocket to activate them all: Efforts on understanding the modulator pocket in K2P channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17891)
*Edward Mendez-Otalvaro,Wojciech Kopec,Marcus Schewe,Bert L. de Groot*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: 本文综述了TREK1 K2P通道中神秘位点“调制蛋白口袋”的作用，探讨其如何激活K2P通道，总结了相关实验和计算证据，并提出了一种跨K2P通道的通用调制蛋白口袋结构，为设计新型选择性调节剂提供参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究调制蛋白口袋如何参与K2P通道的激活机制，以理解其功能和潜在应用。

Method: 通过回顾文献中的门控机制、实验和计算证据，分析调制蛋白口袋的作用及其信号传递方式。

Result: 提出了一种通用的调制蛋白口袋结构模型，强调了其两亲性特性及其在通道序列中的变异，为设计选择性调节剂提供了基础。

Conclusion: 调制蛋白口袋的结构和功能差异可以用于开发新型选择性K2P通道调节剂。

Abstract: The modulator pocket is a cryptic site discovered in the TREK1 K2P channel
that accommodates agonists capable of increasing the channel's activity. Since
its discovery, equivalent sites in other K2P channels have been shown to bind
various ligands, both endogenous and exogenous. In this review, we attempt to
elucidate how the modulator pocket contributes to K2P channel activation. To
this end, we first describe the gating mechanisms reported in the literature
and rationalize their modes of action. We then highlight previous experimental
and computational evidence for agonists that bind to the modulator pocket,
together with mutations at this site that affect gating. Finally, we elaborate
how the activation signal arising from the modulator pocket is transduced to
the gates in K2P channels. In doing so, we outline a potential common modulator
pocket architecture across K2P channels: a largely amphipathic structure
-consistent with the expected properties of a pocket exposed at the interface
between a hydrophobic membrane and the aqueous solvent- but still with some
important channel-sequence-variations. This architecture and its key
differences can be leveraged for the design of new selective and potent
modulators.
