Abstract: In structure-based drug design, accurately estimating the binding affinity
between a candidate ligand and its protein receptor is a central challenge.
Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, have
demonstrated superior performance over traditional empirical and physics-based
methods for this task, enabled by the growing availability of structural and
experimental affinity data. In this work, we introduce DeepGGL, a deep
convolutional neural network that integrates residual connections and an
attention mechanism within a geometric graph learning framework. By leveraging
multiscale weighted colored bipartite subgraphs, DeepGGL effectively captures
fine-grained atom-level interactions in protein-ligand complexes across
multiple scales. We benchmarked DeepGGL against established models on CASF-2013
and CASF-2016, where it achieved state-of-the-art performance with significant
improvements across diverse evaluation metrics. To further assess robustness
and generalization, we tested the model on the CSAR-NRC-HiQ dataset and the
PDBbind v2019 holdout set. DeepGGL consistently maintained high predictive
accuracy, highlighting its adaptability and reliability for binding affinity
prediction in structure-based drug discovery.

Abstract: A device capable of performing real time classification of proteins in a
clinical setting would allow for inexpensive and rapid disease diagnosis. One
such candidate for this technology are nanopore devices. These devices work by
measuring a current signal that arises when a protein or peptide enters a
nanometer-length-scale pore. Should this current be uniquely related to the
structure of the peptide and its interactions with the pore, the signals can be
used to perform identification. While such a method would allow for real time
identification of peptides and proteins in a clinical setting, to date, the
complexities of these signals limit their accuracy. In this work, we tackle the
issue of classification by converting the current signals into scaleogram
images via wavelet transforms, capturing amplitude, frequency, and time
information in a modality well-suited to machine learning algorithms. When
tested on 42 peptides, our method achieved a classification accuracy of
~$81\,\%$, setting a new state-of-the-art in the field and taking a step toward
practical peptide/protein diagnostics at the point of care. In addition, we
demonstrate model transfer techniques that will be critical when deploying
these models into real hardware, paving the way to a new method for real-time
disease diagnosis.
