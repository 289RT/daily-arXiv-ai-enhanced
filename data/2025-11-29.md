Motivation: 生成式AI在蛋白质设计中取得显著进展，但其倾向于采样高频区域，忽略了可能包含重要特性的低概率区域，因此需要引导模型生成具有特定特性的蛋白质。

Method: 分类讨论了参数修改方法（如强化学习、微调）和固定模型方法（如条件生成、检索增强策略、贝叶斯引导和定制采样方法）。

Result: 综述结果显示这些方法能够引导生成模型设计具有特定特性的蛋白质。

Conclusion: 这些发展推动了生成模型在蛋白质设计中的应用，使其能够生成具有所需特性的蛋白质。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models learn probability distributions from data and produce novel samples that capture the salient properties of their training sets. Proteins are particularly attractive for such approaches given their abundant data and the versatility of their representations, ranging from sequences to structures and functions. This versatility has motivated the rapid development of generative models for protein design, enabling the generation of functional proteins and enzymes with unprecedented success. However, because these models mirror their training distribution, they tend to sample from its most probable modes, while low-probability regions, often encoding valuable properties, remain underexplored. To address this challenge, recent work has focused on guiding generative models to produce proteins with user-specified properties, even when such properties are rare or absent from the original training distribution. In this review, we survey and categorize recent advances in conditioning generative models for protein design. We distinguish approaches that modify model parameters, such as reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning, from those that keep the model fixed, including conditional generation, retrieval-augmented strategies, Bayesian guidance, and tailored sampling methods. Together, these developments are beginning to enable the steering of generative models toward proteins with desired, and often previously inaccessible, properties.
