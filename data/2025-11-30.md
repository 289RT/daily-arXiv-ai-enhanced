TL;DR: 生成式AI模型通过学习数据概率分布生成新样本，蛋白质设计的生成模型发展迅速，但因倾向于高概率区域，低概率但有价值的属性常被忽视。近期研究聚焦于引导模型生成用户指定属性的蛋白质，即使这些属性在原训练分布中罕见或缺失。

Motivation: 鉴于蛋白质数据的丰富性和表示的多样性，生成式AI模型在蛋白质设计中的应用具有巨大潜力，但目前模型偏重于高概率区域，限制了低概率但有价值属性的探索。

Method: 通过调整模型参数（如强化学习或监督微调）或固定模型（如条件生成、检索增强策略、贝叶斯引导和定制采样方法）来引导生成模型。

Result: 这些方法开始能够引导生成模型生成具有所需且以往难以获取属性的蛋白质。

Conclusion: 综述指出，通过多样化方法引导生成模型，能够有效扩展蛋白质设计的可能性，尤其是针对罕见或有价值属性的生成。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models learn probability distributions from data and produce novel samples that capture the salient properties of their training sets. Proteins are particularly attractive for such approaches given their abundant data and the versatility of their representations, ranging from sequences to structures and functions. This versatility has motivated the rapid development of generative models for protein design, enabling the generation of functional proteins and enzymes with unprecedented success. However, because these models mirror their training distribution, they tend to sample from its most probable modes, while low-probability regions, often encoding valuable properties, remain underexplored. To address this challenge, recent work has focused on guiding generative models to produce proteins with user-specified properties, even when such properties are rare or absent from the original training distribution. In this review, we survey and categorize recent advances in conditioning generative models for protein design. We distinguish approaches that modify model parameters, such as reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning, from those that keep the model fixed, including conditional generation, retrieval-augmented strategies, Bayesian guidance, and tailored sampling methods. Together, these developments are beginning to enable the steering of generative models toward proteins with desired, and often previously inaccessible, properties.
