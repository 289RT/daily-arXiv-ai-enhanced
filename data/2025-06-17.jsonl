All the three flower extracts excerted marked\nantibacterial activity against both S. aureus and B. cereus. The highest\nantibacterial activity was exhibited by methanol flowers extract (inhibition\nzone: 13.8-0.32mm), with a Minimum inhibitory value of 32mg/ml, against B.\ncereus. The overall order of potency against S. aureus was, chloroform flowers>\nchloroform seeds > hexane leaves > chloroform leaves > methanol flowers> hexane\nflowers> methanol seeds. And against B. cereus was methanol flowers> hexane\nleaves > hexane flowers> chloroform leaves >chloroform flowers >chloroform\nseeds > hexane roots > chloroform roots > methanol seeds chloroform stem barks\n= hexane stem barks. These are all novel findings for A. pedunculata found in\nSri Lanka and elsewhere."}

In a recent study,\nCia et al. (2023) evaluated the performance of conformational B-cell epitope\nprediction methods on a well-curated dataset, revealing that most approaches,\nincluding CBTOPE, exhibited poor performance. One plausible cause of this\ndiminished performance is that available methods were trained on datasets that\nare both limited in size and outdated in content. In this study, we present an\nenhanced version of CBTOPE, trained, tested, and evaluated using the\nwell-curated dataset from Cai et al. (2023). Initially, we developed machine\nlearning-based models using binary profiles, achieving a maximum AUC of 0.58 on\nthe validation dataset. The performance of our method improved significantly\nfrom an AUC of 0.58 to 0.63 when incorporating evolutionary information in the\nform of a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) profile. Furthermore, the\nperformance increased from an AUC of 0.63 to 0.64 when we integrated both the\nPSSM profile and relative solvent accessibility (RSA). All models were trained,\ntested, and optimized on the training dataset using five-fold cross-validation.\nThe final performance of our models was assessed using a validation or\nindependent dataset that was not used during hyperparameter optimization. To\nfacilitate scientific community working in the field of subunit vaccine, we\ndevelop a standalone software and web server CBTOPE2\n(https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cbtope2/)."}

Non-Autoregressive\nTransformers (NATs) have proven highly effective for this task, outperforming\ntraditional methods. Unlike autoregressive models, which generate tokens\nsequentially, NATs predict all positions simultaneously, leveraging\nbidirectional context through unmasked self-attention. However, existing NAT\napproaches often rely on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss,\nwhich presents significant optimization challenges due to CTC's complexity and\nincreases the risk of training failures. To address these issues, we propose an\nimproved non-autoregressive peptide sequencing model that incorporates a\nstructured protein sequence curriculum learning strategy. This approach adjusts\nprotein's learning difficulty based on the model's estimated protein\ngenerational capabilities through a sampling process, progressively learning\npeptide generation from simple to complex sequences. Additionally, we introduce\na self-refining inference-time module that iteratively enhances predictions\nusing learned NAT token embeddings, improving sequence accuracy at a\nfine-grained level. Our curriculum learning strategy reduces NAT training\nfailures frequency by more than 90% based on sampled training over various data\ndistributions. Evaluations on nine benchmark species demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms all previous methods across multiple metrics and species."}

LapDDPM uniquely integrates\ngraph-based representations with a score-based diffusion model, enhanced by a\nnovel spectral adversarial perturbation mechanism on graph edge weights. Our\ncontributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs)\nto enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we\ndevelop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and\ngeneration from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique\nspectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness\nagainst structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq\ndatasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity\nand generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples. LapDDPM sets\na new benchmark for conditional scRNA-seq data generation, offering a robust\ntool for various downstream biological applications."}
