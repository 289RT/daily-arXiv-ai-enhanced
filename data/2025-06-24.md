TL;DR: AbRank是一个大规模的抗体-抗原结合亲和力预测基准框架，将预测任务转化为成对排序问题，并提出了一种稳健的训练方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型受限于实验标签噪声、异构实验条件及泛化能力不足，需要一个更稳健的预测框架。

Method: 基于380,000多个实验数据，AbRank引入了m-confident排序框架和标准化数据分割，并结合图神经网络与蛋白质语言模型。

Result: 基准测试显示现有方法在泛化场景下表现有限，而基于排序的训练提升了模型的鲁棒性和可迁移性。

Conclusion: AbRank为抗体-抗原空间的机器学习模型提供了稳健的基础，对可扩展的结构感知抗体设计有直接应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) binding affinity is essential
for therapeutic design and vaccine development, yet the performance of current
models is limited by noisy experimental labels, heterogeneous assay conditions,
and poor generalization across the vast antibody and antigen sequence space. We
introduce AbRank, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that
reframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem. AbRank aggregates
over 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse
antibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized
data splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local
perturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel
antigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an
m-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal
affinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold
difference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we
introduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein
language model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise
binding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current
methods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that
ranking-based training improves robustness and transferability. In summary,
AbRank offers a robust foundation for machine learning models to generalize
across the antibody-antigen space, with direct relevance for scalable,
structure-aware antibody therapeutic design.

Conclusion: OmniESI为酶-底物相互作用提供了统一的高效预测工具，具有强泛化性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling enzyme-substrate interactions is crucial for
catalytic mechanism research, enzyme engineering, and metabolic engineering.
Although a large number of predictive methods have emerged, they do not
incorporate prior knowledge of enzyme catalysis to rationally modulate general
protein-molecule features that are misaligned with catalytic patterns. To
address this issue, we introduce a two-stage progressive framework, OmniESI,
for enzyme-substrate interaction prediction through conditional deep learning.
By decomposing the modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions into a two-stage
progressive process, OmniESI incorporates two conditional networks that
respectively emphasize enzymatic reaction specificity and crucial
catalysis-related interactions, facilitating a gradual feature modulation in
the latent space from general protein-molecule domain to catalysis-aware
domain. On top of this unified architecture, OmniESI can adapt to a variety of
downstream tasks, including enzyme kinetic parameter prediction,
enzyme-substrate pairing prediction, enzyme mutational effect prediction, and
enzymatic active site annotation. Under the multi-perspective performance
evaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, OmniESI
consistently delivered superior performance than state-of-the-art specialized
methods across seven benchmarks. More importantly, the proposed conditional
networks were shown to internalize the fundamental patterns of catalytic
efficiency while significantly improving prediction performance, with only
negligible parameter increases (0.16%), as demonstrated by ablation studies on
key components. Overall, OmniESI represents a unified predictive approach for
enzyme-substrate interactions, providing an effective tool for catalytic
mechanism cracking and enzyme engineering with strong generalization and broad
applicability.

Abstract: Over the last decade, proteomic analysis of single cells by mass spectrometry
transitioned from an uncertain possibility to a set of robust and rapidly
advancing technologies supporting the accurate quantification of thousands of
proteins. We review the major drivers of this progress, from establishing
feasibility to powerful and increasingly scalable methods. We focus on the
tradeoffs and synergies of different technological solutions within a coherent
conceptual framework, which projects considerable room both for throughput
scaling and for extending the analysis scope to functional protein
measurements. We highlight the potential of these technologies to support the
development of mechanistic biophysical models and help uncover new principles.
