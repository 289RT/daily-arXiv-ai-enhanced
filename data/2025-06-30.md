Abstract: The low complexity domain of Fused in Sarcoma (FUS-LC consisting of 214
residues) undergoes phase separation, resulting in a dense liquid-like phase
that forms early and slowly matures to reach ordered gel-like state on long
time scales. Upon maturation, core-1, comprising of the 57 residues (39-95) in
the N-terminus become structured, resulting in the formation of a
non-polymorphic fibril. The truncated FUS-LC-C (residues 110-214) construct
forms a fibril in which core-2 (residues 112-150) adopts a $\beta$-sheet
structure. Using coarse-grained monomer SOP-IDP model simulations of FUS-LC, we
predict that residues 155-190 in the C-terminal (core-3) form rapidly, followed
by core-2, and finally core-1. The time scale of formation of the cores and
their stabilities are inversely correlated, as anticipated by the Ostwald's
rule of stages. Unbiased multichain simulations show that the chemical
potentials in the two phases are equal and the calculated densities of the
dense and dilute phases are in agreement with experiments. The dense phase,
which forms by a nucleation mechanism, coarsens over time by a process that is
reminiscent of Ostwald ripening. AlphaFold predictions of the core-3 structure
and the simulations show that $\beta$-strand emerges in the core-3 region early
during the droplet formation, and drives the initiation of FUS-LC assembly. The
techniques introduced here are general and could be used to probe assembly of
other IDPs such as TDP-43, which shares many features with FUS-LC.
