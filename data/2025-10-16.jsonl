The\nstudy explores proximity-based hotspot mapping at the CD4 binding site,\ncentroid distance penalization, generative loss tuning, and custom loss\nfunction development. These enhancements produced cyclic peptides that closely\nresemble the binding conformation of the CD4 attachment inhibitor BMS-818251.\nThe proposed methodology demonstrates improved structural control and precision\nin cyclic peptide generation, advancing the applicability of AlphaFold in\nstructure-based drug discovery."}
