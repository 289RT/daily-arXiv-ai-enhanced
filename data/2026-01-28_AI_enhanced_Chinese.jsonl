Currently, generative models dominate functional protein design but cannot model pocket-substrate interactions, which limits the generation of enzymes with precise catalytic environments. To address this issue, we propose EnzyPGM, a unified framework that jointly generates enzymes and substrate-binding pockets conditioned on functional priors and substrates, with a particular focus on learning accurate pocket-substrate interactions. At its core, EnzyPGM includes two main modules: a Residue-atom Bi-scale Attention (RBA) that jointly models intra-residue dependencies and fine-grained interactions between pocket residues and substrate atoms, and a Residue Function Fusion (RFF) that incorporates enzyme function priors into residue representations. Also, we curate EnzyPock, an enzyme-pocket dataset comprising 83,062 enzyme-substrate pairs across 1,036 four-level enzyme families. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EnzyPGM achieves state-of-the-art performance on EnzyPock. Notably, EnzyPGM reduces the average binding energy of 0.47 kcal/mol over EnzyGen, showing its superior performance on substrate-specific enzyme design. The code and dataset will be released later.", "AI": {"tldr": "EnzyPGM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u9176\u548c\u5e95\u7269\u7ed3\u5408\u53e3\u888b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5e95\u7269-\u53e3\u888b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u9176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5e95\u7269\u7ed3\u5408\u53e3\u888b\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u53e3\u888b-\u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u50ac\u5316\u73af\u5883\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "EnzyPGM\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1aResidue-atom Bi-scale Attention\uff08RBA\uff09\u548cResidue Function Fusion\uff08RFF\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528EnzyPock\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eEnzyPGM\u5728EnzyPock\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u6bd4EnzyGen\u4f4e0.47 kcal/mol\u3002", "conclusion": "EnzyPGM\u5728\u5e95\u7269\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u9176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c06\u53d1\u5e03\u3002"}}

In many AI for science tasks, labeled data are expensive to obtain and therefore limited in availability. Under the few-shot setting, models trained with scarce supervision often learn brittle structure-property relationships, resulting in substantially higher prediction errors and reduced generalization to unseen molecules. To address this limitation, we propose PCEvo, a path-consistent representation method that learns from virtual paths through dynamic structural evolution. PCEvo enumerates multiple chemically feasible edit paths between retrieved similar molecular pairs under topological dependency constraints. It transforms the labels of the two molecules into stepwise supervision along each virtual evolutionary path. It introduces a path-consistency objective that enforces prediction invariance across alternative paths connecting the same two molecules. Comprehensive experiments on the QM9 and MoleculeNet datasets demonstrate that PCEvo substantially improves the few-shot generalization performance of baseline methods.
