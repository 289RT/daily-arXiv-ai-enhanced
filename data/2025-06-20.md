Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies. However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models, hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically, researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17 state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent correlations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a streamlined evaluation protocol.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现中，同时优化分子以满足多个治疗目标面临巨大挑战，主要由于稀疏奖励和冲突的设计约束。因此，需要一种新方法来平衡化学多样性、分子质量和多靶点亲和力。

Method: 方法结合了序列到序列变分自编码器和主动学习，通过迭代循环扩展潜在空间的化学可行区域，并逐步基于多靶点对接阈值约束分子。

Result: 在针对三种冠状病毒主蛋白酶（SARS-CoV-2、SARS-CoV、MERS-CoV）的概念验证研究中，该方法成功生成了一个结构多样的泛抑制剂候选集。化学滤波器的战略安排显著提升了对有益化学空间的探索。

Conclusion: 该框架为高效导航复杂的多药理学景观提供了通用路线图，将稀疏奖励的多目标药物设计问题转化为可计算的任务。

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity, molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological landscapes.

TL;DR: 研究了多种HPC硬件在计算生物学软件上的性能，发现硬件多样性对支持不同方法至关重要，GPU效率高但支持复杂，数据存储和系统管理是挑战。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同HPC硬件在计算生物学软件中的性能和适用性，以指导硬件选择和优化资源配置。

Method: 在多款HPC硬件上测试GROMACS等软件的原始性能、能效和数据存储需求，并分析用户体验和软件环境。

Result: 没有单一硬件能最优运行所有任务，GPU效率高但支持复杂，数据存储和管理面临挑战。

Conclusion: 应通过多样化硬件、DevOps培训和容器化工具来优化HPC系统支持计算生物学研究。

Abstract: A range of computational biology software (GROMACS, AMBER, NAMD, LAMMPS, OpenMM, Psi4 and RELION) was benchmarked on a representative selection of HPC hardware, including AMD EPYC 7742 CPU nodes, NVIDIA V100 and AMD MI250X GPU nodes, and an NVIDIA GH200 testbed. The raw performance, power efficiency and data storage requirements of the software was evaluated for each HPC facility, along with qualitative factors such as the user experience and software environment. It was found that the diversity of methods used within computational biology means that there is no single HPC hardware that can optimally run every type of HPC job, and that diverse hardware is the only way to properly support all methods. New hardware, such as AMD GPUs and Nvidia AI chips, are mostly compatible with existing methods, but are also more labour-intensive to support. GPUs offer the most efficient way to run most computational biology tasks, though some tasks still require CPUs. A fast HPC node running molecular dynamics can produce around 10GB of data per day, however, most facilities and research institutions lack short-term and long-term means to store this data. Finally, as the HPC landscape has become more complex, deploying software and keeping HPC systems online has become more difficult. This situation could be improved through hiring/training in DevOps practices, expanding the consortium model to provide greater support to HPC system administrators, and implementing build frameworks/containerisation/virtualisation tools to allow users to configure their own software environment, rather than relying on centralised software installations.
