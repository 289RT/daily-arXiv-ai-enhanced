Motivation: 研究旨在确定蛋白质折叠是否存在统一的物理原理，以及如何用最小作用量原理描述折叠过程，同时解决Levinthal悖论。

Method: 提出有效轨迹猜想，认为蛋白质折叠可通过单一折叠速率的多条路径实现，并在合理时间内达到稳定态。

Result: 初步结果表明，蛋白质折叠可能受最小作用量原理支配，为折叠路径和动力学速度提供了物理模型。

Conclusion: 最小作用量原理可能是蛋白质折叠的普适物理模型，连接了动力学速度与热力学稳定性。

Abstract: The primary aims of this perspective are twofold. Firstly, to assess whether a universal principle could govern the process of protein folding. Secondly, to clarify whether the folding of a protein could be characterized by an effective trajectory, as determined by the principle of least action, while concurrently addressing the Levinthal Paradox. The effective-trajectory conjecture, which is compatible with the existence of multiple folding pathways and characterized by a single folding rate, addresses the search timescale paradox by explaining how a protein in a proper environment always reaches its native state at a consistent folding rate and in a biologically reasonable time frame (as determined by the thermodynamic hypothesis, or Anfinsen dogma). The preliminary findings support the hypothesis that the protein folding process is governed by a universal principle: that of least action. From this viewpoint, it should be regarded as a fundamental physical model that not only facilitates the identification of folding pathways and trajectories but also offers a physical framework for understanding how nature may link the optimal kinetic speed of the protein folding process with its higher thermodynamic stability.

### [2] [UNAAGI: Atom-Level Diffusion for Generating Non-Canonical Amino Acid Substitutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10515)
*Han Tang,Wouter Boomsma*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: UNAAGI是一个基于扩散的生成模型，用于从原子级结构重建氨基酸序列，支持自然和非自然氨基酸替换，性能优于现有方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法仅限于设计自然氨基酸序列，而无法利用非自然氨基酸的化学多样性。本文将解决这一限制。

Method: 提出UNAAGI模型，采用E(3)-等变框架，以原子级细节建模侧链，支持自然和非自然氨基酸替换。

Result: 在实验基准数据集上验证，UNAAGI在非自然氨基酸替换上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UNAAGI为蛋白工程和药物设计提供了共享的方法基础，有望统一这两者的训练框架。

Abstract: Proposing beneficial amino acid substitutions, whether for mutational effect prediction or protein engineering, remains a central challenge in structural biology. Recent inverse folding models, trained to reconstruct sequences from structure, have had considerable impact in identifying functional mutations. However, current approaches are constrained to designing sequences composed exclusively of natural amino acids (NAAs). The larger set of non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs), which offer greater chemical diversity, and are frequently used in in-vivo protein engineering, remain largely inaccessible for current variant effect prediction methods.
  To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{UNAAGI}, a diffusion-based generative model that reconstructs residue identities from atomic-level structure using an E(3)-equivariant framework. By modeling side chains in full atomic detail rather than as discrete tokens, UNAAGI enables the exploration of both canonical and non-canonical amino acid substitutions within a unified generative paradigm. We evaluate our method on experimentally benchmarked mutation effect datasets and demonstrate that it achieves substantially improved performance on NCAA substitutions compared to the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our results suggest a shared methodological foundation between protein engineering and structure-based drug design, opening the door for a unified training framework across these domains.
