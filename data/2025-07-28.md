Conclusion: PKAG-DDI通过结合药物间的生物学功能，提高了DDIE文本的生成质量和实用性。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) arise when multiple drugs are administered
concurrently. Accurately predicting the specific mechanisms underlying DDIs
(named DDI events or DDIEs) is critical for the safe clinical use of drugs.
DDIEs are typically represented as textual descriptions. However, most
computational methods focus more on predicting the DDIE class label over
generating human-readable natural language increasing clinicians'
interpretation costs. Furthermore, current methods overlook the fact that each
drug assumes distinct biological functions in a DDI, which, when used as input
context, can enhance the understanding of the DDIE process and benefit DDIE
generation by the language model (LM). In this work, we propose a novel
pairwise knowledge-augmented generative method (termed PKAG-DDI) for DDIE text
generation. It consists of a pairwise knowledge selector efficiently injecting
structural information between drugs bidirectionally and simultaneously to
select pairwise biological functions from the knowledge set, and a pairwise
knowledge integration strategy that matches and integrates the selected
biological functions into the LM. Experiments on two professional datasets show
that PKAG-DDI outperforms existing methods in DDIE text generation, especially
in challenging inductive scenarios, indicating its practicality and
generalization.

Abstract: Traditional drug discovery relies on rounds of screening millions of
candidate molecules with low success rates, making drug discovery time and
resource intensive. To overcome this screening bottleneck, we introduce
Latent-X, an all-atom protein design model that enables a new paradigm of
precision AI design. Given a target protein epitope, Latent-X jointly generates
the all atom structure and sequence of the protein binder and target, directly
modelling the non-covalent interactions essential for specific binding. We
demonstrate its efficacy across two therapeutically relevant modalities through
extensive wet lab experiments, testing as few as 30-100 designs per target. For
macrocyclic peptides, Latent-X achieves experimental hit rates exceeding 90% on
all evaluated benchmark targets. For mini-binders, it consistently produces
potent candidates against all evaluated benchmark targets, with binding
affinities reaching the low nanomolar and picomolar range - comparable to those
of approved therapeutics - whilst also being highly specific in mammalian
display. In direct comparisons with the state-of-the-art models AlphaProteo,
RFdiffusion and RFpeptides under identical conditions demonstrates, Latent-X
generates binders with higher hit rates and better binding affinities, and
uniquely creates structurally diverse binders, including complex beta-sheet
folds. Its end-to-end process is an order of magnitude faster than existing
multi-step computational pipelines. By drastically improving the efficiency and
success rate of de novo design, Latent-X represents a significant advance
towards push-button biologics discovery and a valuable tool for protein
engineers. Latent-X is available at https://platform.latentlabs.com, enabling
users to reliably generate de novo binders without AI infrastructure or coding.
