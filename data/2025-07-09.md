Motivation: 蛋白质-蛋白质结合能的准确估计对结构生物学和药物设计至关重要，但现有深度学习方法因数据稀缺而表现不佳。

Method: 采用迁移学习方法，将结合能参数化为复合物折叠能与单个蛋白折叠能之和的差值，利用预训练的逆折叠模型进行零样本预测，并通过折叠能和结合能数据微调模型。

Result: StaB-ddG在精度上与FoldX相当，但速度提升了1000倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为蛋白质-蛋白质结合能预测提供了一种高效且准确的深度学习方法。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of mutational effects on protein-protein binding energies
is an open problem with applications in structural biology and therapeutic
design. Several deep learning predictors for this task have been proposed, but,
presumably due to the scarcity of binding data, these methods underperform
computationally expensive estimates based on empirical force fields. In
response, we propose a transfer-learning approach that leverages advances in
protein sequence modeling and folding stability prediction for this task. The
key idea is to parameterize the binding energy as the difference between the
folding energy of the protein complex and the sum of the folding energies of
its binding partners. We show that using a pre-trained inverse-folding model as
a proxy for folding energy provides strong zero-shot performance, and can be
fine-tuned with (1) copious folding energy measurements and (2) more limited
binding energy measurements. The resulting predictor, StaB-ddG, is the first
deep learning predictor to match the accuracy of the state-of-the-art empirical
force-field method FoldX, while offering an over 1,000x speed-up.
