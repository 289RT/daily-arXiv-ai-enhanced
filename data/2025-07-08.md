TL;DR: DisProtBench是一个新的蛋白质结构预测模型评估基准，专注于结构无序和复杂生物条件，通过多维度和统一方法评估模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构预测的基准未能充分评估模型在生物挑战性环境（如内在无序区域）中的表现，限制了其在药物发现等应用中的实用性。

Method: DisProtBench通过三个维度评估模型性能：数据复杂性（如无序区域和复合体）、任务多样性（12种模型的多任务评估）和可解释性（提供可视化工具）。

Result: 结果表明模型在无序环境下的稳健性差异显著，全局准确性指标在无序设置中预测任务表现不佳，需功能感知评估。

Conclusion: DisProtBench为评估下一代蛋白质结构预测模型提供了可重复、可扩展且生物学基础扎实的框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction have achieved near-atomic
accuracy for well-folded proteins. However, current benchmarks inadequately
assess model performance in biologically challenging contexts, especially those
involving intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), limiting their utility in
applications such as drug discovery, disease variant interpretation, and
protein interface design. We introduce DisProtBench, a comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating protein structure prediction models (PSPMs) under structural
disorder and complex biological conditions. DisProtBench spans three key axes:
(1) Data complexity, covering disordered regions, G protein-coupled receptor
(GPCR) ligand pairs, and multimeric complexes; (2) Task diversity, benchmarking
twelve leading PSPMs across structure-based tasks with unified classification,
regression, and interface metrics; and (3) Interpretability, via the
DisProtBench Portal, which provides precomputed 3D structures and visual error
analyses. Our results reveal significant variability in model robustness under
disorder, with low-confidence regions linked to functional prediction failures.
Notably, global accuracy metrics often fail to predict task performance in
disordered settings, emphasizing the need for function-aware evaluation.
DisProtBench establishes a reproducible, extensible, and biologically grounded
framework for assessing next-generation PSPMs in realistic biomedical
scenarios.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 人类气味结合蛋白（OBPs）的传统功能是作为嗅觉中的气味转运体，但其在生殖组织中的表达暗示了其在激素转运和癌症进展中的潜在作用。本文通过计算分析探讨了OBP基因变异对生殖癌症中基因表达的影响，并总结了OBP的结构特征与功能假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管OBPs在嗅觉中的功能尚未完全明确，但它们在生殖组织中的表达引发了对其非嗅觉功能的探索，尤其是与激素依赖型癌症的潜在关联。

Method: 利用RNA-seq和蛋白质组学数据，结合计算分析，研究了OBP基因的体细胞拷贝数变异和单核苷酸变异对基因表达的影响。

Result: 体细胞拷贝数变异与OBP基因表达在生殖癌症中的显著变化相关，而点突变影响较小。OBP结构与功能的研究支持其在癌症生物学中的潜在作用。

Conclusion: OBPs可能具有超出嗅觉的多种功能，尤其是与激素转运和癌症进展相关，未来研究应关注其在非嗅觉领域的作用和应用。

Abstract: Until today, the exact function of mammalian odorant binding proteins (OBPs)
remains a topic of debate. Although their main established function lacks
direct evidence in human olfaction, OBPs are traditionally believed to act as
odorant transporters in the olfactory sense, which led to the exploration of
OBPs as biomimetic sensor units in artificial noses. Now, available RNA-seq and
proteomics data identified the expression of human OBPs (hOBP2A and hOBP2B) in
both, male and female reproductive tissues. This observation prompted the
conjecture that OBPs may possess functions that go beyond the olfactory sense,
potentially as hormone transporters. Such a function could further link them to
the tumorigenesis and cancer progression of hormone dependent cancer types
including ovarian, breast, prostate and uterine cancer. In this structured
review, we use available data to explore the effects of genetic alterations
such as somatic copy number aberrations and single nucleotide variants on OBP
function and their corresponding gene expression profiles. Our computational
analyses suggest that somatic copy number aberrations in OBPs are associated
with large changes in gene expression in reproductive cancers while point
mutations have little to no effect. Additionally, the structural
characteristics of OBPs, together with other lipocalin family members, allow us
to explore putative functions within the context of cancer biology. Our
overview consolidates current knowledge on putative human OBP functions, their
expression patterns, and structural features. Finally, it provides an overview
on applications, highlighting emerging hypotheses and future research
directions within olfactory and non-olfactory roles.

### [3] [Quantitative Single-particle Profiling of Extracellular Vesicles via Fluorescent Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04655)
*Yiting Liu,Anthony James El-helou,Bill Soderstrom,Juanfang Ruan,Ying Zhu*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种优化的荧光纳米颗粒追踪分析（F-NTA）协议，用于单颗粒水平的细胞外囊泡（EV）定量分析，结合荧光免疫标记和尺寸排除色谱（SEC），实现了EV浓度、大小分布和表面免疫表型的精确量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于EV的异质性需要单颗粒水平的分析方法，而传统的散射纳米颗粒追踪分析（NTA）缺乏特异性，因此开发了一种优化的F-NTA协议以提高分析精度。

Method: 通过荧光免疫标记EV并结合SEC去除未结合的标签，使用F-NTA对EV进行定量分析，并通过双标记技术区分EV亚群和非囊泡颗粒。

Result: 实验验证了该协议可有效去除未结合标签，并能区分不同表面标记的EV亚群（如EpCAM阳性EV）。此外，双标记技术成功应用于血浆样本中EV和非囊泡颗粒的同时分析。

Conclusion: 优化的F-NTA协议为EV的应用（如生物标志物发现、治疗监测和工程囊泡质量控制）提供了可靠的定量分析工具。

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have drawn rapidly increasing attention as the
next-generation diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic agents. However, the
heterogeneous nature of EVs necessitates advanced methods for profiling EVs at
the single-particle level. While nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) is a
widely used technique for quantifying particle size and concentration,
conventional scattering-based systems are non-specific. In this study, we
present an optimised protocol for quantitative profiling of EVs at the
single-particle level by fluorescent NTA (F-NTA). The protocol integrates
fluorescent immunolabeling of EVs with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to
efficiently remove unbound labels, enabling the precise quantification of EV
concentration, size distribution, and surface immunophenotype. We first
validated this approach using biotinylated liposomes and EVs from cultured
human cell lines, confirming effective removal of unbound labels and assessing
labelling efficiency. We then demonstrated that F-NTA can distinguish EV
subpopulations with distinct surface marker expression, exemplified by the
differentiation of EpCAM-positive EVs derived from HT29 and HEK293 cells.
Finally, we applied dual labelling to human plasma isolates to simultaneously
profile EVs and non-vesicular extracellular particles, providing a quantitative
quality assessment of EV purity at the single-particle level. The robustness of
this method was further supported by comparative analysis with total internal
reflection fluorescence microscopy. This validated workflow enables robust,
quantitative profiling of EV subpopulations, providing a critical tool for
diverse EV applications, including biomarker discovery, therapeutic monitoring,
and quality control for engineered vesicles.

### [4] [Large Language Model Agent for Modular Task Execution in Drug Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02925)
*Janghoon Ock,Radheesh Sharma Meda,Srivathsan Badrinarayanan,Neha S. Aluru,Achuth Chandrasekhar,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的模块化框架，用于自动化早期计算药物发现中的关键任务，包括数据检索、分子生成和3D结构生成等，并通过案例研究展示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过结合LLM和领域工具，优化计算药物发现流程，提高任务效率和准确性。

Method: 利用LLM进行推理，结合领域工具完成生物医学数据检索、分子生成、性质预测和3D结构生成等任务。

Result: 案例研究中，框架成功生成了多样化的分子，提高了分子质量（如QED > 0.6的分子数量增加），并提供了快速的结合亲和力估计。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助药物发现提供了可扩展的基础，支持分子筛选和优先级排序。

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that
automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug
discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the
framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question
answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular
refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study
targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved
relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES
representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with
improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically
diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided
iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of
molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least
four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a
pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D
protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for
candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively
supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its
modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,
providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

### [5] [Molecular Machine Learning Using Euler Characteristic Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03474)
*Victor Toscano-Duran,Florian Rottach,Bastian Rieck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了使用欧拉特征变换（ECT）作为分子形状的几何拓扑描述符，结合传统分子表示方法，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子形状对其物理化学和生物性质至关重要，但在标准的分子表示学习中常被忽视，因此需要一种能有效捕捉分子形状的方法。

Method: 通过欧拉特征变换（ECT）直接从分子图中提取多尺度结构特征，并与传统表示（如分子指纹和GNNs）进行对比和结合。

Result: ECT表示在多个基准数据集上表现优异，尤其是与AVALON指纹结合时，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 结合明确形状信息的混合方法能生成更鲁棒的分子表示，为分子机器学习任务提供了新思路。代码和实验数据已公开。

Abstract: The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological
properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular
representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor.
Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic
features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features,
offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature
space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine
benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition
constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation
against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular
fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show
that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking
among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its
combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON
fingerprint, significantly \emph{enhances predictive performance},
outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the
complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for
being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid
approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more
informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new
avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and
foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and
code used in this work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRING是首个从图层次评估蛋白质相互作用预测的综合性基准，提供高质量多物种PPI数据集和两种评估范式，揭示现有模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅关注孤立成对评估，忽视了模型的生物意义网络重建能力，PRING填补了这一空白。

Method: PRING构建包含21,484蛋白质和186,818相互作用的多物种数据集，设计拓扑和功能导向的评估任务。

Result: 实验表明当前模型在恢复PPI网络结构和功能特性上存在局限。

Conclusion: PRING为开发更有效的PPI预测模型提供可靠平台。

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in
predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's
capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is
crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the
first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction
prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,
multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818
interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and
leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two
complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess
intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented
tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and
essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's
capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein
function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism
analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,
consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language
model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI
models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional
properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world
biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide
the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The
dataset and source code of PRING are available at

### [7] [Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction in Transformers for Interpreting TCR-pMHC Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03197)
*Jiarui Li,Zixiang Yin,Haley Smith,Zhengming Ding,Samuel J. Landry,Ramgopal R. Mettu*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QCAI的新方法，用于解释变压器解码器中的交叉注意力机制，并在TCR-XAI基准上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解TCR与pMHC结合的机制对免疫系统和治疗开发至关重要，但现有方法缺乏可解释性。

Method: 开发了QCAI方法，专门用于解释变压器解码器的交叉注意力机制，并利用TCR-XAI基准进行定量评估。

Result: QCAI在可解释性和预测准确性方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: QCAI为解决TCR-pMHC建模中的可解释性问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: CD8+ "killer" T cells and CD4+ "helper" T cells play a central role in the
adaptive immune system by recognizing antigens presented by Major
Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules via T Cell Receptors (TCRs).
Modeling binding between T cells and the pMHC complex is fundamental to
understanding basic mechanisms of human immune response as well as in
developing therapies. While transformer-based models such as TULIP have
achieved impressive performance in this domain, their black-box nature
precludes interpretability and thus limits a deeper mechanistic understanding
of T cell response. Most existing post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods are
confined to encoder-only, co-attention, or model-specific architectures and
cannot handle encoder-decoder transformers used in TCR-pMHC modeling. To
address this gap, we propose Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction (QCAI), a
new post-hoc method designed to interpret the cross-attention mechanisms in
transformer decoders. Quantitative evaluation is a challenge for XAI methods;
we have compiled TCR-XAI, a benchmark consisting of 274 experimentally
determined TCR-pMHC structures to serve as ground truth for binding. Using
these structures we compute physical distances between relevant amino acid
residues in the TCR-pMHC interaction region and evaluate how well our method
and others estimate the importance of residues in this region across the
dataset. We show that QCAI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
interpretability and prediction accuracy under the TCR-XAI benchmark.
