Motivation: 研究射频辐射对酶活性的影响，尤其是葡萄糖-6-磷酸脱氢酶。

Method: 使用2.45 GHz、0.1 W的射频辐射照射酶样品91小时，比较处理组与对照组活性。

Result: 射频辐射能保留酶活性，对照组活性下降，效应可能为非热性。

Conclusion: 2.45 GHz射频辐射能通过非热效应保存酶活性，与其他酶系统的研究结果一致。

Abstract: In this report we evaluate the effect in the enzyme activity of Glucose 6-phosphate Dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides by irradiation with 2.45 GHz radiofrequency at a power output of 0.1 W during a 91 h period. The results show that the RF irradiation preserves the activity of treated samples of this enzyme with respect to a non-treated sample that instead suffer an increased rate of activity loss. Our estimates indicate that the enzyme activation is due to a non-thermal effect. The results are consistent with reports about the effect of 2.45 GHz radiation upon other enzymatic systems.

Conclusion: 后翻译修饰和客户端招募通过不同物理机制调控缩合物组成，揭示了其重要性。

Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are commonly organized by a small number of scaffold molecules that drive phase separation together with client molecules that do not condense on their own but become selectively recruited into the dense phase. A central open question is how client recruitment feeds back on scaffold interactions to determine condensate composition. Here we address this problem in a reconstituted focal adhesion system composed of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphorylated p130Cas (Cas) as scaffolds and the adaptor protein paxillin (PXN) as a client. We show that both FAK phosphorylation and PXN recruitment produce a common compositional response in which FAK becomes enriched while Cas is depleted within the condensate. To interpret these observations, we develop two complementary theoretical descriptions. First, within a two-component Flory-Huggins framework, we show that phosphorylation can be captured by either strengthening heterotypic FAK-Cas interactions or increasing the effective number of interaction-relevant segments on FAK, both of which bias partitioning toward FAK-rich condensates. Second, we introduce a minimal three-component Flory-Huggins theory without an explicit solvent and map it onto an effective two-component description, demonstrating that client recruitment renormalizes homotypic and heterotypic scaffold interactions. Analytical predictions for the location of the critical point are tested in reconstituted multicomponent systems through PXN addition, showing that client recruitment alone tunes proximity to criticality and reshapes condensate composition. Together, our results reveal distinct yet convergent physical routes by which post-translational modification and client recruitment control scaffold composition in multicomponent condensates.

Abstract: A continuous route from a disordered soup of simple chemical feedstocks to a functional protocell -- a compartment that metabolizes, grows, and propagates -- remains elusive. Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes. Internal spherules that are themselves growth-competent are produced within the protocells, establishing a rudimentary mode of self-perpetuation. The chemical dynamics we observe in controlled laboratory conditions also occur in reaction mixtures exposed to natural day-night cycles. Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.
