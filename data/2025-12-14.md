*Jorge Vila*

Main category: q-bio.BM

Motivation: 研究目的是确定蛋白质折叠过程是否受普遍原理支配，并验证最小作用量原理是否适用于描述蛋白质的有效折叠轨迹。

Method: 通过有效轨迹猜想，结合多重折叠路径和单一折叠速率，解释蛋白质如何在合理时间内达到其自然状态。

Result: 初步结果表明，蛋白质折叠过程受最小作用量原理支配，这一模型为理解折叠路径和动力学速度提供了物理框架。

Conclusion: 最小作用量原理是蛋白质折叠的基本物理模型，有助于联结折叠过程的动力学速度与热力学稳定性。

Abstract: The primary aims of this perspective are twofold. Firstly, to assess whether a universal principle could govern the process of protein folding. Secondly, to clarify whether the folding of a protein could be characterized by an effective trajectory, as determined by the principle of least action, while concurrently addressing the Levinthal Paradox. The effective-trajectory conjecture, which is compatible with the existence of multiple folding pathways and characterized by a single folding rate, addresses the search timescale paradox by explaining how a protein in a proper environment always reaches its native state at a consistent folding rate and in a biologically reasonable time frame (as determined by the thermodynamic hypothesis, or Anfinsen dogma). The preliminary findings support the hypothesis that the protein folding process is governed by a universal principle: that of least action. From this viewpoint, it should be regarded as a fundamental physical model that not only facilitates the identification of folding pathways and trajectories but also offers a physical framework for understanding how nature may link the optimal kinetic speed of the protein folding process with its higher thermodynamic stability.

### [2] [UNAAGI: Atom-Level Diffusion for Generating Non-Canonical Amino Acid Substitutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10515)
*Han Tang,Wouter Boomsma*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: UNAAGI是一个基于扩散的生成模型，用于探索非经典氨基酸（NCAAs）的替换，填补当前方法仅支持自然氨基酸（NAAs）的空白。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前逆折叠模型仅能设计自然氨基酸序列，无法利用非经典氨基酸更丰富的化学多样性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用E(3)-等变框架的扩散生成模型，从原子级结构重建残基身份，支持经典和非经典氨基酸替换的统一生成。

Result: 在实验数据集上表现优异，尤其在非经典氨基酸替换上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UNAAGI为蛋白质工程和基于结构的药物设计提供了共享方法范式，推动了领域的统一。

Abstract: Proposing beneficial amino acid substitutions, whether for mutational effect prediction or protein engineering, remains a central challenge in structural biology. Recent inverse folding models, trained to reconstruct sequences from structure, have had considerable impact in identifying functional mutations. However, current approaches are constrained to designing sequences composed exclusively of natural amino acids (NAAs). The larger set of non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs), which offer greater chemical diversity, and are frequently used in in-vivo protein engineering, remain largely inaccessible for current variant effect prediction methods.
  To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{UNAAGI}, a diffusion-based generative model that reconstructs residue identities from atomic-level structure using an E(3)-equivariant framework. By modeling side chains in full atomic detail rather than as discrete tokens, UNAAGI enables the exploration of both canonical and non-canonical amino acid substitutions within a unified generative paradigm. We evaluate our method on experimentally benchmarked mutation effect datasets and demonstrate that it achieves substantially improved performance on NCAA substitutions compared to the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our results suggest a shared methodological foundation between protein engineering and structure-based drug design, opening the door for a unified training framework across these domains.
