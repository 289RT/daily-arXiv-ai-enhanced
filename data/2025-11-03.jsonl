Rapamycin and WDB002 are molecular glues that bind to\nFK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and target the FKBP12-rapamycin-associated\nprotein (FRAP) and the centrosomal protein 250 (CEP250), respectively. Here, we\nused molecular dynamics simulations to gain insights into the effects of\nmolecular glues on protein conformation and PPIs. The molecular glues modulated\nprotein flexibility, leading to less flexibility in some regions, and changed\nthe pattern and stability of water-mediated hydrogen bonds between the\nproteins. Our findings highlight the importance of considering water-mediated\nhydrogen bonds in developing strategies for the rational design of molecular\nglues."}

While the\nidea of a folding code embedded in the amino acid sequence was introduced more\nthan 6 decades ago, this code remains undefined. While we now have powerful\npredictive tools to predict the final native structure of proteins, we still\nlack a predictive framework for how sequences dictate folding pathways. Two\nmain conceptual models dominate as explanations of folding mechanism: the\nfunnel model, in which folding proceeds through many alternative routes on a\nrugged, hyperdimensional energy landscape; and the foldon model, which proposes\na hierarchical sequence of discrete intermediates. Recent advances on two\nfronts are now enabling folding studies in unprecedented ways. Powerful\nexperimental approaches; in particular, single-molecule force spectroscopy and\nhydrogen (deuterium exchange assays) allow time-resolved tracking of the\nfolding process at high resolution. At the same time, computational\nbreakthroughs culminating in algorithms such as AlphaFold have revolutionized\nstatic structure prediction, opening opportunities to extend machine learning\ntoward dynamics. Together, these developments mark a turning point: for the\nfirst time, we are positioned to resolve how proteins fold, why they misfold,\nand how this knowledge can be harnessed for biology and medicine."}

Here, we study single molecules of superfamily\n1A DNA helicase Rep, which undergo conformational transitions during bacterial\nDNA replication, repair and recombination. We use time-correlated single-photon\ncounting (TCSPC), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), rapid\nsingle-molecule F\\\"orster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), Anti-Brownian\nELectrokinetic (ABEL) trapping and molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) to\nprovide unparalleled temporal and spatial resolution of Rep's domain movements.\nWe detect four states revealing two hitherto hidden intermediates (S2, S3),\nbetween the open (S1) and closed (S4) structures, whose stability is salt\ndependent. Rep's open-to-closed switch involves multiple changes to all four\nsubdomains 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B along the S1 to S2 to S3 to S4 transitional\npathway comprising an initial truncated swing of 2B which then rolls across the\n1B surface, following by combined rotations of 1B, 2A and 2B. High forward and\nreverse rates for S1 to S2 suggest that 1B may act to frustrate 2B movement to\nprevent premature Rep closure in the absence of DNA. These observations support\na more general binding model for accessory DNA helicases that utilises\nconformational plasticity to explore a multiplicity of structures whose\nlandscape can be tuned by salt prior to locking-in upon DNA binding."}
