However, these advances\ncome at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive\noperators, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines,\nwhich collectively hinder the scalability of AF3 training. In this work, we\npresent MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold\ntackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle\ntime from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for\nmemory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for\ncommon and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and\nAMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by\nup to 1.23$\\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to\n1.73$\\times$ and 1.62$\\times$ respectively. More importantly, MegaFold enables\ntraining on 1.35$\\times$ longer sequence lengths compared to PyTorch baselines\nwithout running out-of-memory, significantly improving the scalability of\nmodern protein folding models.

However,\nmost existing docking methods and deep learning approaches hardly account for\nthe formation of covalent bonds and the associated structural changes. To\naddress this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for covalent docking,\nCovDocker, which is designed to better capture the complexities of covalent\nbinding. We decompose the covalent docking process into three main tasks:\nreactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent\ndocking. By adapting state-of-the-art models, such as Uni-Mol and Chemformer,\nwe establish baseline performances and demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nbenchmark in accurately predicting interaction sites and modeling the molecular\ntransformations involved in covalent binding. These results confirm the role of\nthe benchmark as a rigorous framework for advancing research in covalent drug\ndesign. It underscores the potential of data-driven approaches to accelerate\nthe discovery of selective covalent inhibitors and addresses critical\nchallenges in therapeutic development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aCovDocker\u7684\u5171\u4ef7\u5bf9\u63a5\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u5171\u4ef7\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5b50\u8f6c\u6362\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5171\u4ef7\u952e\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u53ca\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5171\u4ef7\u5bf9\u63a5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u53cd\u5e94\u4f4d\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5171\u4ef7\u53cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5171\u4ef7\u5bf9\u63a5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528Uni-Mol\u548cChemformer\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4f4d\u70b9\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u8f6c\u6362\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u5171\u4ef7\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CovDocker\u4e3a\u5171\u4ef7\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6cbb\u7597\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}
