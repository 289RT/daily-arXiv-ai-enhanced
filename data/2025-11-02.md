Motivation: 研究聚合马尔可夫模型在离子通道建模中的应用，特别是解决模型参数过多时的非可识别性问题。

Method: 通过P\'olya枚举计算多状态模型的参数限制，分析非可识别性，并以三态模型为例深入探讨。

Result: 发现当参数超过2n_O n_C时，模型不可识别；建议依赖额外数据而非假设的生物物理状态转换来建模。

Conclusion: 强调直接利用动态变化数据比假设状态转换更有效，为离子通道建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Aggregated Markov models provide a flexible framework for stochastic dynamics
that develops on multiple timescales. For example, Markov models for ion
channels often consist of multiple open and closed state to account for "slow"
and "fast" openings and closings of the channel. The approach is a popular tool
in the construction of mechanistic models of ion channels - instead of viewing
model states as generators of sojourn times of a certain characteristic length,
each individual model state is interpreted as a representation of a distinct
biophysical state. We will review the properties of aggregated Markov models
and discuss the implications for mechanistic modelling. First, we show how the
aggregated Markov models with a given number of states can be calculated using
P\'olya enumeration However, models with $n_O$ open and $n_C$ closed states
that exceed the maximum number $2 n_O n_C$ of parameters are non-identifiable.
We will present two derivations for this classical result and investigate
non-identifiability further via a detailed analysis of the non-identifiable
fully connected three-state model. Finally, we will discuss the implications of
non-identifiability for mechanistic modelling of ion channels. We will argue
that instead of designing models based on assumed transitions between distinct
biophysical states which are modulated by ligand binding, it is preferable to
build models based on additional sources of data that give more direct insight
into the dynamics of conformational changes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mRNA设计和优化在合成生物学和治疗开发中至关重要，但机器学习领域对此研究较少，且系统优化受限于稀缺且不平衡的数据及复杂的序列功能关系。

Method: RNAGenScape结合了组织自动编码器和流形投影器，通过目标属性结构化的潜在空间进行高效探索，并在稀缺数据下保持稳健性。

Result: 在三个真实mRNA数据集中，RNAGenScape以高成功率和效率提升了目标属性，优于其他生成或优化方法。

Conclusion: RNAGenScape为可控mRNA设计和潜在空间探索提供了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: mRNA design and optimization are important in synthetic biology and
therapeutic development, but remain understudied in machine learning.
Systematic optimization of mRNAs is hindered by the scarce and imbalanced data
as well as complex sequence-function relationships. We present RNAGenScape, a
property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework that iteratively updates
mRNA sequences within a learned latent manifold. RNAGenScape combines an
organized autoencoder, which structures the latent space by target properties
for efficient and biologically plausible exploration, with a manifold projector
that contracts each step of update back to the manifold. RNAGenScape supports
property-guided optimization and smooth interpolation between sequences, while
remaining robust under scarce and undersampled data, and ensuring that
intermediate products are close to the viable mRNA manifold. Across three real
mRNA datasets, RNAGenScape improves the target properties with high success
rates and efficiency, outperforming various generative or optimization methods
developed for proteins or non-biological data. By providing continuous,
data-aligned trajectories that reveal how edits influence function, RNAGenScape
establishes a scalable paradigm for controllable mRNA design and latent space
exploration in mRNA sequence modeling.
