Here, we show that infrared fluorescent proteins (IRFPs) can be used as genetically encoded SRS probes and benefit from the electronic pre-resonant SRS enhancement effect with near-infrared exciting pulses, comparable to synthetic dyes reported in the literature. SRS imaging of the nucleus in mammalian cells is demonstrated where a histone protein is fused to an IRFP. This work opens the route towards Raman-based cell imaging using genetically encoded probes, motivating efforts in solving the challenges of photostability and creating a vibrational palette.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u7ea2\u5916\u8367\u5149\u86cb\u767d\uff08IRFPs\uff09\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u56e0\u7f16\u7801\u7684SRS\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u9884\u5171\u632f\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u80de\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u62c9\u66fc\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u6210\u50cf\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dSRS\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u867d\u5728\u8d85\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u7ec6\u80de\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u56e0\u7f16\u7801\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528IRFPs\u4f5c\u4e3aSRS\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u6fc0\u53d1\u8109\u51b2\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u9884\u5171\u632f\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5728\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\u7ec6\u80de\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86SRS\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06IRFP\u4e0e\u7ec4\u86cb\u767d\u878d\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u56e0\u7f16\u7801\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u62c9\u66fc\u7ec6\u80de\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5149\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}
