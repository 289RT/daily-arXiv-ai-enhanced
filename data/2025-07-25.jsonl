In this study, carbon\nnanoparticles (CNPs) were synthesized by the one-pot hydrothermal carbonization\n(HTC) using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Urea was used as the nitrogen source\nfor carbonization. The presence of urea in CMC solution for carbonization\nresulted in CNPsu reduction in the diameter of particles from 4 micrometer to 1\nmicrometer. Activation process at high temperature for both the above samples\nresulted in nanoparticles with diameter of 51 nm and 31 nm, respectively. The\npositive effect of presence urea and its activation generated different\nfunctional groups including C-N, N-H, and C -(triple bond)- N with increasing\naromatic rings that probably may help entrapment of drugs into them. On the\nother hand, activation CNPsu (ACNPsu) has the most aromatic rings with the\nlowest hydroxyl groups with 84.66% carbon and 12.29% oxygen in its structures.\nACNPs, and ACNPsu exhibited a type I isotherm indicating microporous materials\nwith a high surface area about 552.9 m2/g and 351.01 m2/g, respectively. The\nhigh surface area was characteristic of activated carbons with their high\nadsorption capacity. Thus, the synthesized materials were characterized using\nSEM, TEM, DLS, BET, FTIR, HNMR, and TGA techniques. Finally, the encapsulation\nof clindamycin drug (CD) with positive charge in different types of NPs with\nnegative charge was investigated for drug delivery in biomedical engineering\napplications."}

To\nsidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a\nmodel on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'\n$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in\nthe opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed\non 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more\ndiverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.\nMoreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot\ndesign tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase\nthe diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With\nits simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic\nbears the potential to become the $\\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning\nstrategy for de novo molecule design."}

Endres"], "title": "The unreasonable likelihood of being: origin of life, terraforming, and AI", "categories": ["q-bio.PE", "q-bio.BM"], "comment": "14 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "The origin of life on Earth via the spontaneous emergence of a protocell\nprior to Darwinian evolution remains a fundamental open question in physics and\nchemistry. Here, we develop a conceptual framework based on information theory\nand algorithmic complexity. Using estimates grounded in modern computational\nmodels, we evaluate the difficulty of assembling structured biological\ninformation under plausible prebiotic conditions. Our results highlight the\nformidable entropic and informational barriers to forming a viable protocell\nwithin the available window of Earth's early history. While the idea of Earth\nbeing terraformed by advanced extraterrestrials might violate Occam's razor\nfrom within mainstream science, directed panspermia -- originally proposed by\nFrancis Crick and Leslie Orgel -- remains a speculative but logically open\nalternative. Ultimately, uncovering physical principles for life's spontaneous\nemergence remains a grand challenge for biological physics."}
