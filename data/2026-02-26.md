Abstract: Characterizing the geometric boundaries of protein secondary structures is fundamental to understanding macromolecular folding. By applying the discrete Hasimoto map to translate backbone geometry into a one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schrödinger potential $V_{\mathrm{re}}[n]$, we establish a frequency-domain framework for protein conformations. Short-time Fourier transform analysis across 320,453 residues from 1,986 non-redundant proteins defines a local spectral entropy $H_{\mathrm{spec}}$ that consistently orders structural states. Helical segments emerge as narrow-band low-entropy regimes dominated by zero-frequency components, whereas coils manifest as broadband noise. We demonstrate that boundaries separating these states exhibit step-like sharpness characteristic of a first-order-like geometric transition with a sub-residue median width of 0.145 residues. This abrupt kinematic transition provides a spatial counterpart to the cooperative Zimm--Bragg thermodynamic model of helix nucleation. The extreme spatial narrowness exposes an intrinsic limitation governed by the Gabor uncertainty principle, explaining why the pointwise integrability residual $E[n]$ acts as an effective high-pass filter for boundary detection. Guided by this limit we introduce a dual-probe approach combining the high-pass residual for local torsion discontinuities with a low-frequency energy ratio $R_{\mathrm{LF}}$ measuring the DC-dominated flatness of helical interiors. Unifying these complementary signals improves the detection area under the curve from 0.783 to 0.815. Because high-entropy broadband regions coincide with the flexible loops and hinges implicated in allostery, the spectral entropy of the Hasimoto potential may serve as a sequence-agnostic geometric proxy for mapping functional dynamics from backbone coordinates.
