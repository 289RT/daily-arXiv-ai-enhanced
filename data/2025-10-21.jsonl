To obtain atomic detailed multiple conformations and make full\nuse of particle images of different orientations, we present here CryoDyna, a\ndeep learning framework to infer macromolecular dynamics directly from 2D\nprojections by integrating cross-view attention and multi-scale deformation\nmodeling. Combining coarse-grained MARTINI representation with atomic\nbackmapping, CryoDyna achieves near-atomic interpretation of protein\nconformational landscapes. Validated on multiple simulated and experimental\ndatasets, CryoDyna demonstrates improved modeling accuracy and robustly\nrecovers multi-scale complex structure changes hidden in the cryo-EM particle\nstacks. As examples, we generated protein-RNA coordinated motions, resolved\ndynamics in the unseen region of RAG signal end complex, mapped translocating\nribosome states in a one-shot manner, and revealed step-wise closure of a\nmembrane-anchored protein multimer. This work bridges the gap between cryo-EM\nheterogeneity analysis and atomic-scale structural dynamics, offering a\npromising tool for exploration of complex biological mechanisms."}

Yet\nthis advancement is intrinsically linked to new vulnerabilities, as GenAI\nlowers the barrier to misuse and introduces novel biosecurity threats, such as\ngenerating synthetic viral proteins or toxins. These dual-use risks are often\noverlooked, as existing safety guardrails remain fragile and can be\ncircumvented through deceptive prompts or jailbreak techniques. In this\nPerspective, we first outline the current state of GenAI in the biosciences and\nemerging threat vectors ranging from jailbreak attacks and privacy risks to the\ndual-use challenges posed by autonomous AI agents. We then examine urgent gaps\nin regulation and oversight, drawing on insights from 130 expert interviews\nacross academia, government, industry, and policy. A large majority ($\\approx\n76$\\%) expressed concern over AI misuse in biology, and 74\\% called for the\ndevelopment of new governance frameworks. Finally, we explore technical\npathways to mitigation, advocating a multi-layered approach to GenAI safety.\nThese defenses include rigorous data filtering, alignment with ethical\nprinciples during development, and real-time monitoring to block harmful\nrequests. Together, these strategies provide a blueprint for embedding security\nthroughout the GenAI lifecycle. As GenAI becomes integrated into the\nbiosciences, safeguarding this frontier requires an immediate commitment to\nboth adaptive governance and secure-by-design technologies."}

Inspired by Neural\nOrdinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth\nformulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural\nODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This\ncontinuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the\nadjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and\naccuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure\nprediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces\nstructurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary\nstructure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate\nthe accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this\nperformance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on\na single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a\nlightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling.

In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using\ngeneral-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring\nlabeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the\nmolecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs\na one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical\nlabels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this\nposition-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class\nexamples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to\nsingle-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed.\nAcross academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our\nwork enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically\nplausible reaction sites ($\\geq90\\%$), named reaction classes ($\\geq40\\%$), and\nfinal reactants ($\\geq74\\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work\nalso provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by\nmapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing\ndata scarcity."}

We focus on the\nlarge scale regime, where dataset sizes are limited by the cost of measurement\nand sequencing. We show that when active sequences are rare, we maximize\ninformation gain if we only collect positive examples of active sequences, i.e.\n$x$ with $y>0$. We can correct for the missing negative examples using a\ngenerative model of the library, producing a consistent and efficient estimate\nof the true $p(y | x)$.

Objective comparison between simulation approaches is\noften hindered by inconsistent evaluation metrics, insufficient sampling of\nrare conformational states, and the absence of reproducible benchmarks. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce a modular benchmarking framework that\nsystematically evaluates protein MD methods using enhanced sampling analysis.\nOur approach uses weighted ensemble (WE) sampling via The Weighted Ensemble\nSimulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), based on\nprogress coordinates derived from Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis\n(TICA), enabling fast and efficient exploration of protein conformational\nspace. The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that\nsupports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and\nmachine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a\ncomprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different\nmetrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a\ndataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a\nvariety of folding complexities and topologies. Each protein has been\nextensively simulated at 300K for one million MD steps per starting point (4\nns). To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we perform validation tests\nusing classic MD simulations with implicit solvent and compare protein\nconformational sampling using a fully trained versus under-trained CGSchNet\nmodel. By standardizing evaluation protocols and enabling direct, reproducible\ncomparisons across MD approaches, our open-source platform lays the groundwork\nfor consistent, rigorous benchmarking across the molecular simulation\ncommunity."}
