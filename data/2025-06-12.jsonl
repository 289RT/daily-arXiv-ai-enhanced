However,\nduring intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), this barrier is disrupted,\nleading to extensive immune cell infiltration and localized inflammation. In\ndegenerated discs, macrophages, T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and granulocytic\nmyeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) are key players, exhibiting\nfunctional heterogeneity. Dysregulated activation of inflammatory pathways,\nincluding nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and\nnucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)\ninflammasome activation, drives local pro-inflammatory responses, leading to\ncell apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Innovative\nimmunotherapies, including exosome-based treatments, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene\nediting, and chemokine-loaded hydrogel systems, have shown promise in reshaping\nthe immunological niche of intervertebral discs. These strategies can modulate\ndysregulated immune responses and create a supportive environment for tissue\nregeneration. However, current studies have not fully elucidated the mechanisms\nof inflammatory memory and the immunometabolic axis, and they face challenges\nin balancing tissue regeneration with immune homeostasis. Future studies should\nemploy interdisciplinary approaches such as single-cell and spatial\ntranscriptomics to map a comprehensive immune atlas of IDD, elucidate\nintercellular crosstalk and signaling networks, and develop integrated\ntherapies combining targeted immunomodulation with regenerative engineering,\nthereby facilitating the clinical translation of effective IDD treatments."}

In some cases, the effects of the surface interactions can propagate\ninwards, and even can interfere with a similar propagation from opposite\nsurfaces. This can be particularly evident in liquid water under\nnano-confinement. The large dipolar cross-correlations among distinct molecules\nthat give rise to the unusually large dielectric constant of water (and in turn\nowe their origin to the extended hydrogen bond (HB) network) can get perturbed\nby surfaces. The perturbation can propagate inwards and then interfere with the\none from the opposite surface if confinement is only a few layers wide. This\ncan give rise to short-to-intermediate range solvent-mediated interaction\nbetween two surfaces. Here we study the effects of such interactions on the\ndielectric constant of nano-confined liquids, not just water but also ordering\nat protein surfaces. The surfaces work at two levels: (i) induce orientational\nrealignment, and (ii) alter the cross-correlations between water molecules.\nMolecular dynamics simulations and statistical analyses are used to address\nthese aspects in confinement of slit pores, nano tube/cylinder, and nano\nsphere. In addition, we consider the hydration layers of multiple proteins with\nvastly different structural features. These studies give us a measure of the\nextent or the length scale of cross-correlations between dipole moments of\nwater molecules. We find an interesting orientational arrangement in the\nprotein hydration layers, giving rise to long-range molecular\ncross-correlations. To decouple the effect of HB from the effect of geometry,\nwe additionally study acetonitrile under nanoconfinement. Importantly, while a\nprotein's interior is characterized by a small dielectric constant, the dipole\nmoment of a peptide bond is large, and thus susceptible to fluctuations in\nwater."}

We propose two algorithms, which are\nboth validated by extensive numerical simulations showing that the ensuing\nlattice random walks have not only the same power-law covariance function as\nthe standard fBm, but also individual trajectories follow those of the\nsuper-diffusive fBm. Finding a lattice and an integer time analogue of a\nsub-diffusion fBm, which is an anti-persistent process, remains a challenging\nopen problem. Our results also clarify the relevant difference between\nsub-diffusive and super-diffusive fBm, that are frequently seen as two very\nanalogous realizations of processes with memory. They are indeed substantially\ndifferent."}
