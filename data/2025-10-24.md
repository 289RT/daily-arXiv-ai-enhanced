Motivation: 已有数学模型假设生物膜基质是均匀的，忽略了细胞外空间的详细机制，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用细胞-胶囊方法，将细菌胶囊视为一个低扩散相，通过模型分析生物膜形态的几何模式及其对氧气传输的影响。

Result: 研究发现，厚胶囊/密集基质排列可减少局部氧气传输约70%。

Conclusion: 生物膜的胶囊结构作为‘串联阻力’屏障，显著影响氧气传输，这一发现可能推动关于早期生物膜发展中氧气限制的研究。

Abstract: The extracellular matrix of biofilms presents a dense and intricate
architecture. Numerous biophysical properties of the matrix surrounding
microbial cells contribute to the heterogeneity of biofilms and their functions
at the microscale. Previous mathematical models assume the matrix to be
homogeneous, often overlooking the need for a detailed mechanistic
understanding of the extracellular space. In this theoretical study, we
introduce a novel cell-capsule approach to investigate geometric patterns in
biofilm morphology and predict their role in oxygen transport. The thickness of
the capsule and the arrangement of cell-capsule patterns can influence matrix
heterogeneity, providing a clear picture of biofilm structure. By incorporating
the bacterial capsule as a distinct, low-diffusivity phase, our novel
cell-capsule model reveals that this architecture acts as a significant
'resistance-in-series' barrier. We found that a thick capsule/dense matrix
arrangement can reduce local oxygen transfer by approximately 70%, a
substantial drop that may give drive further research into oxygen limitations
during early stage biofilm development.

### [2] [Predicting Protein-Nucleic Acid Flexibility Using Persistent Sheaf Laplacians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20788)

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Persistent Sheaf Laplacian（PSL）的新框架，用于预测蛋白质-核酸复合物的B因子，相比传统模型（如GNM和ENM），PSL在多尺度分析和数据表示方面表现出色，Pearson相关系数提高了21%。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质-核酸复合物的灵活性对其结构和功能至关重要，但传统模型在捕捉多尺度相互作用方面表现不佳，尤其是在复杂的生物分子系统中。

Method: 论文采用PSL框架，结合多尺度分析、代数拓扑、组合拉普拉斯和层理论，通过其谐波和非谐波谱揭示数据拓扑不变量和形状演化。

Result: PSL在三种不同数据集上的性能优于GNM和mFRI，B因子预测的Pearson相关系数提高了21%。

Conclusion: PSL展示了在建模复杂生物分子相互作用方面的鲁棒性和适应性，未来可能在突变影响分析和药物设计等领域有广泛应用。

Abstract: Understanding the flexibility of protein-nucleic acid complexes, often
characterized by atomic B-factors, is essential for elucidating their
structure, dynamics, and functions, such as reactivity and allosteric pathways.
Traditional models such as Gaussian Network Models (GNM) and Elastic Network
Models (ENM) often fall short in capturing multiscale interactions, especially
in large or complex biomolecular systems. In this work, we apply the Persistent
Sheaf Laplacian (PSL) framework for the B-factor prediction of protein-nucleic
acid complexes. The PSL model integrates multiscale analysis, algebraic
topology, combinatoric Laplacians, and sheaf theory for data representation. It
reveals topological invariants in its harmonic spectra and captures the
homotopic shape evolution of data with its non-harmonic spectra. Its
localization enables accurate B-factor predictions. We benchmark our method on
three diverse datasets, including protein-RNA and nucleic-acid-only structures,
and demonstrate that PSL consistently outperforms existing models such as GNM
and multiscale FRI (mFRI), achieving up to a 21% improvement in Pearson
correlation coefficient for B-factor prediction. These results highlight the
robustness and adaptability of PSL in modeling complex biomolecular
interactions and suggest its potential utility in broader applications such as
mutation impact analysis and drug design.

### [3] [BadGraph: A Backdoor Attack Against Latent Diffusion Model for Text-Guided Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20792)
*Liang Ye,Shengqin Chen,Jiazhu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的后门攻击方法BadGraph，揭示了其安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究文本引导图生成中潜在扩散模型的后门漏洞，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过文本触发器毒害训练数据，在推理时植入后门，诱导攻击者指定的子图。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证了攻击的有效性（10%毒化率可达50%攻击成功率），且对正常样本影响小。

Conclusion: 揭示了文本引导图生成中的安全风险，强调了在该类扩散模型中防御后门攻击的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.
