Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 研究探讨了蛋白质运动与结合稳定性之间的关系，分析了SARS-CoV-2刺突蛋白变体与ACE2受体的结合，发现结合稳定性与未结合状态下的蛋白质刚性和动态模式相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解蛋白质-蛋白质复合物结合亲和力的分子决定因素，特别是构象动力学中的熵贡献。

Method: 通过分子动力学模拟分析了多个SARS-CoV-2刺突蛋白变体在未结合（apo）和结合（holo）状态下的结构和动态差异。

Result: 更稳定的结合与未结合状态下更高的蛋白质刚性及与结合后相似的动态模式相关；SARS-CoV-2进化不仅由结合稳定性驱动，还涉及抗体逃逸等其他性状。

Conclusion: 完全理解蛋白质间结合强度需要研究孤立伙伴的稳定性。

Abstract: The functionality of protein-protein complexes is closely tied to the
strength of their interactions, making the evaluation of binding affinity a
central focus in structural biology. However, the molecular determinants
underlying binding affinity are still not fully understood. In particular, the
entropic contributions, especially those arising from conformational dynamics,
remain poorly characterized. In this study, we explore the relationship between
protein motion and binding stability and its role in protein function. To gain
deeper insight into how protein complexes modulate their stability, we
investigated a model system with a well-characterized and fast evolutionary
history: a set of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants bound to the human ACE2
receptor, for which experimental binding affinity data are available. Through
Molecular Dynamics simulations, we analyzed both structural and dynamical
differences between the unbound (apo) and bound (holo) forms of the spike
protein across several variants of concern. Our findings indicate that a more
stable binding is associated with proteins that exhibit higher rigidity in
their unbound state and display dynamical patterns similar to that observed
after binding to ACE2. The increase of binding stability is not the sole
driving force of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. More recent variants are characterized
by a more dynamical behavior that determines a less efficient viral entry but
could optimize other traits, such as antibody escape. These results suggest
that to fully understand the strength of the binding between two proteins, the
stability of the two isolated partners should be investigated.

### [2] [A cautious user's guide in applying HMMs to physical systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05707)
*Max Schweiger,Ayush Saurabh,Steve Pressé*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在连续演化的物理系统中应用离散状态、离散时间的隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）的影响，指出HMM的推断状态更多反映测量协议和建模选择而非潜在物理特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究HMM在分析连续物理系统数据时的适用性，揭示其可能导致的误解。

Method: 使用朗之万动力学产生的合成数据，分析HMM在不同情况下的表现。

Result: HMM推断的状态可能由测量协议和建模选择主导，甚至能误导性地重现可重复的“中间”状态。

Conclusion: HMM在物理建模中需谨慎使用，建议推广到连续时空并校准测量噪声模型。

Abstract: Nature, as far as we know, evolves continuously through space and time. Yet
the ubiquitous hidden Markov model (HMM)--originally developed for discrete
time and space analysis in natural language processing--remains a central tool
in interpreting time series data drawn from from physical systems. This raises
a fundamental question: What are the implications of applying a discrete-state,
discrete-time framework to analyze data generated by a continuously evolving
system? Through synthetic data generated using Langevin dynamics in an
effective potential, we explore under what circumstances HMMs yield
interpretable results. Our analysis reveals that the discrete-state
approximation acts primarily as an abstraction with the inferred states visited
in time often more closely reflecting the measurement protocol and modeling
choices than features of the underlying physical potential. Crucially, we
demonstrate that the states visited over the course of a time series recovered
by the HMM can be tuned a priori by adjusting the data acquisition scheme even
misleadingly recovering reproducible "intermediate" states using different HMM
tools for a system evolving in a single well potential. We conclude with a note
of measured caution: while HMMs offer a mathematically elegant framework for
time series inference, their use in physical modeling should be guided by an
awareness of their limitations. In this light, we outline important
generalizations of the HMM to continuous space and time and highlight the
importance of a well calibrated measurement noise model.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 本文总结了无序区域（IDRs）的功能预测挑战及新兴计算方法，提出了社区驱动框架以改进其功能注释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于IDRs缺乏稳定结构、序列进化快速且行为依赖上下文，其功能预测是主要挑战。

Method: 利用计算生物学和机器学习（如蛋白质语言模型、无对齐方法和IDR专用方法）揭示IDRs的保守特征和功能相关局部模体。

Result: 新兴计算方法能够映射IDRs的序列-功能关系，但仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 提出社区驱动框架以加速IDRs的可解释功能预测。

Abstract: Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) account for one-third of the human
proteome and play essential biological roles. However, predicting the functions
of IDRs remains a major challenge due to their lack of stable structures, rapid
sequence evolution, and context-dependent behavior. Many predictors of protein
function neglect or underperform on IDRs. Recent advances in computational
biology and machine learning, including protein language models, alignment-free
approaches, and IDR-specific methods, have revealed conserved bulk features and
local motifs within IDRs that are linked to function. This review highlights
emerging computational methods that map the sequence-function relationship in
IDRs, outlines critical challenges in IDR function annotation, and proposes a
community-driven framework to accelerate interpretable functional predictions
for IDRs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了逆折叠模型与自由能理论之间的联系，并提出了改进零-shot蛋白质稳定性预测的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管逆折叠模型在预测蛋白质稳定性方面表现优异，但其与热力学稳定性的自由能基础之间的联系尚未完全理解。作者希望通过研究这一联系，提升模型的预测能力。

Method: 论文通过理论推导揭示了当前似然比方法的简化性，并提出了几种改进相对稳定性估计的路径，随后通过实验验证了这些方法的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，通过简单的方法可以实现零-shot性能的显著提升。

Conclusion: 研究不仅从理论上阐明了逆折叠模型的自由能基础，还为提升蛋白质稳定性预测提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot
predictors of protein stability. Despite this success, the link between the
amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy
considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely
understood. A better understanding would be of interest not only from a
theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger
zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the
free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the
standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and
suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We
empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in
zero-shot performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统虚拟筛选方法依赖holo蛋白结构，而在早期药物发现中，apo或预测结构更常见，需要更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 采用双模态对比学习和交叉注意力适配器，增强对口袋定位错误的鲁棒性，并动态聚合候选结合位点。

Result: 在apo结构基准测试中，EF1%从11.75提升至37.19，同时在holo结构上表现仍然强劲。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏实验解析的蛋白-配体复合物场景中，有望推动首创新药的发现。

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet
most existing methods--whether physics-based or deep learning-based--are
developed around holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets.
Consequently, their performance degrades significantly on apo or predicted
structures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of
real-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often
missing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to
enable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method
comprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that
aligns representations of the ligand, the holo pocket, and cavities detected
from structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and
(2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate
binding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without
precise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated
benchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment
factor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong
performance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our
approach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios
lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.
