Abstract: Protein-ligand binding affinity is critical in drug discovery, but
experimentally determining it is time-consuming and expensive. Artificial
intelligence (AI) has been used to predict binding affinity, significantly
accelerating this process. However, the high-performance requirements and vast
datasets involved in affinity prediction demand increasingly large AI models,
requiring substantial computational resources and training time. Quantum
machine learning has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. In
particular, hybrid quantum-classical models can reduce the number of parameters
while maintaining or improving performance compared to classical counterparts.
Despite these advantages, challenges persist: why hybrid quantum models achieve
these benefits, whether quantum neural networks (QNNs) can replace classical
neural networks, and whether such models are feasible on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these
challenges by proposing a hybrid quantum neural network (HQNN) that empirically
demonstrates the capability to approximate non-linear functions in the latent
feature space derived from classical embedding. The primary goal of this study
is to achieve a parameter-efficient model in binding affinity prediction while
ensuring feasibility on NISQ devices. Numerical results indicate that HQNN
achieves comparable or superior performance and parameter efficiency compared
to classical neural networks, underscoring its potential as a viable
replacement. This study highlights the potential of hybrid QML in computational
drug discovery, offering insights into its applicability and advantages in
addressing the computational challenges of protein-ligand binding affinity
prediction.

Abstract: Strategies to improve the predicting performance of Message-Passing
Neural-Networks for molecular property predictions can be achieved by
simplifying how the message is passed and by using descriptors that capture
multiple aspects of molecular graphs. In this work, we designed model
architectures that achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing more
complex models such as those pre-trained on external databases. We assessed
dataset diversity to complement our performance results, finding that
structural diversity influences the need for additional components in our MPNNs
and feature sets.
  In most datasets, our best architecture employs bidirectional message-passing
with an attention mechanism, applied to a minimalist message formulation that
excludes self-perception, highlighting that relatively simpler models, compared
to classical MPNNs, yield higher class separability. In contrast, we found that
convolution normalization factors do not benefit the predictive power in all
the datasets tested. This was corroborated in both global and node-level
outputs. Additionally, we analyzed the influence of both adding spatial
features and working with 3D graphs, finding that 2D molecular graphs are
sufficient when complemented with appropriately chosen 3D descriptors. This
approach not only preserves predictive performance but also reduces
computational cost by over 50%, making it particularly advantageous for
high-throughput screening campaigns.

*Xuefeng Liu,Songhao Jiang,Qinan Huang,Tinson Xu,Ian Foster,Mengdi Wang,Hening Lin,Jinbo Xu,Rick Stevens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FragmentGPT是一种集成化学感知和能量基预训练的新型模型，用于解决FBDD中连接片段和结构冗余的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FBDD中设计有效连接片段和结构冗余的难题。

Method: 结合化学感知预训练和RAE算法，生成多目标优化的分子连接。

Result: 生成的分子在癌症数据集上表现良好，适用于药物发现。

Conclusion: FragmentGPT为分子组装提供了可控、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fragment-Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) is a popular approach in early drug
development, but designing effective linkers to combine disconnected molecular
fragments into chemically and pharmacologically viable candidates remains
challenging. Further complexity arises when fragments contain structural
redundancies, like duplicate rings, which cannot be addressed by simply adding
or removing atoms or bonds. To address these challenges in a unified framework,
we introduce FragmentGPT, which integrates two core components: (1) a novel
chemically-aware, energy-based bond cleavage pre-training strategy that equips
the GPT-based model with fragment growing, linking, and merging capabilities,
and (2) a novel Reward Ranked Alignment with Expert Exploration (RAE) algorithm
that combines expert imitation learning for diversity enhancement, data
selection and augmentation for Pareto and composite score optimality, and
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to align the learner policy with multi-objective
goals. Conditioned on fragment pairs, FragmentGPT generates linkers that
connect diverse molecular subunits while simultaneously optimizing for multiple
pharmaceutical goals. It also learns to resolve structural redundancies-such as
duplicated fragments-through intelligent merging, enabling the synthesis of
optimized molecules. FragmentGPT facilitates controlled, goal-driven molecular
assembly. Experiments and ablation studies on real-world cancer datasets
demonstrate its ability to generate chemically valid, high-quality molecules
tailored for downstream drug discovery tasks.

Abstract: The enzyme turnover rate is a fundamental parameter in enzyme kinetics,
reflecting the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. However, enzyme turnover rates
remain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of
experimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
framework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme
sequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines
a pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract
features from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures
informative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is
incorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate
representations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that
govern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate
predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms
both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This work
provides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics and holds promise for
applications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis.
