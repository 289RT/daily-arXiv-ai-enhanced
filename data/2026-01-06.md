*Myeongsang Lee,Lauren L. Porter*

Main category: q-bio.BM

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质的功能高度依赖于其构象集合，但目前深度学习方法在预测单蛋白质结构方面虽有进展，但对构象集合的建模仍是挑战。折叠转换蛋白质由于其结构重组的特性，可作为方法泛化性的测试案例。

Method: 研究聚焦于折叠转换蛋白质的建模，探讨深度学习模型在预测构象集合时的局限性，并提出潜在的成功和失败用例。

Result: 结果显示深度学习模型往往通过关联训练集结构来预测构象集合，限制了泛化性。

Conclusion: 开发能够从大量候选蛋白质中识别折叠转换蛋白质的计算方法，可能有助于更广泛地建模构象集合。

Abstract: A protein's function depends critically on its conformational ensemble, a collection of energy weighted structures whose balance depends on temperature and environment. Though recent deep learning (DL) methods have substantially advanced predictions of single protein structures, computationally modeling conformational ensembles remains a challenge. Here, we focus on modeling fold-switching proteins, which remodel their secondary and/or tertiary structures and change their functions in response to cellular stimuli. These underrepresented members of the protein universe serve as test cases for a method's generalizability. They reveal that DL models often predict conformational ensembles by association with training-set structures, limiting generalizability. These observations suggest use cases for when DL methods will likely succeed or fail. Developing computational methods that successfully identify new fold-switching proteins from large pools of candidates may advance modeling conformational ensembles more broadly.

### [2] [Predicting Early and Complete Drug Release from Long-Acting Injectables Using Explainable Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02265)
*Karla N. Robles,Manar D. Samad*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于可解释机器学习的新方法，用于优化聚合物长效注射剂（LAIs）的药物释放动力学，并通过三个实验分析材料特性对释放曲线的影响。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长效注射剂（LAIs）在慢性疾病治疗中具有重要意义，但药物释放的优化需要复杂的物理化学性质调整，机器学习可以加速这一过程。然而，现有研究缺乏针对LAI数据的定制化建模和分析。

Method: 论文采用数据转换和可解释机器学习方法，通过预测24、48和72小时的药物释放、分类释放曲线类型以及预测完整释放曲线，分析了321种LAI配方。

Result: 研究发现，72小时的药物释放预测与真实值的相关性超过0.65，释放曲线分类的F1分数为0.87。时间无关的ML框架在预测延迟双相和三相曲线时表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了之前体外和机器学习研究的空白，为科学家优化LAI的药物释放动力学提供了定量策略和建议。模型源代码已公开。

Abstract: Polymer-based long-acting injectables (LAIs) have transformed the treatment of chronic diseases by enabling controlled drug delivery, thus reducing dosing frequency and extending therapeutic duration. Achieving controlled drug release from LAIs requires extensive optimization of the complex underlying physicochemical properties. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate LAI development by modeling the complex relationships between LAI properties and drug release. However, recent ML studies have provided limited information on key properties that modulate drug release, due to the lack of custom modeling and analysis tailored to LAI data. This paper presents a novel data transformation and explainable ML approach to synthesize actionable information from 321 LAI formulations by predicting early drug release at 24, 48, and 72 hours, classification of release profile types, and prediction of complete release profiles. These three experiments investigate the contribution and control of LAI material characteristics in early and complete drug release profiles. A strong correlation (>0.65) is observed between the true and predicted drug release in 72 hours, while a 0.87 F1-score is obtained in classifying release profile types. A time-independent ML framework predicts delayed biphasic and triphasic curves with better performance than current time-dependent approaches. Shapley additive explanations reveal the relative influence of material characteristics during early and for complete release which fill several gaps in previous in-vitro and ML-based studies. The novel approach and findings can provide a quantitative strategy and recommendations for scientists to optimize the drug-release dynamics of LAI. The source code for the model implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce materiomusic as a generative framework linking the hierarchical structures of matter with the compositional logic of music. Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention. We show that science and art are generative acts of world-building under constraint, with vibration as a shared grammar organizing structure across scales.
