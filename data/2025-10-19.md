Motivation: 分子优化需要精确的结构推理和领域知识，但LLM在非直观表示（如SMILES）中执行编辑意图时表现不佳。

Method: MECo采用级联框架：首先生成人类可理解的编辑意图，然后通过代码生成将这些意图转化为可执行的结构编辑。

Result: MECo在重现化学反应的编辑任务中达到98%的准确率，并在下游优化任务中显著提升一致性和成功率。

Conclusion: MECo通过意图与执行的结合，实现了更可控、可解释的分子设计，为药物发现中的人机协同工作奠定了基础。

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires
precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in
natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.
