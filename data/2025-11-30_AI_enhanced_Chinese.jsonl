Proteins are particularly attractive for such approaches given their abundant data and the versatility of their representations, ranging from sequences to structures and functions. This versatility has motivated the rapid development of generative models for protein design, enabling the generation of functional proteins and enzymes with unprecedented success. However, because these models mirror their training distribution, they tend to sample from its most probable modes, while low-probability regions, often encoding valuable properties, remain underexplored. To address this challenge, recent work has focused on guiding generative models to produce proteins with user-specified properties, even when such properties are rare or absent from the original training distribution. In this review, we survey and categorize recent advances in conditioning generative models for protein design. We distinguish approaches that modify model parameters, such as reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning, from those that keep the model fixed, including conditional generation, retrieval-augmented strategies, Bayesian guidance, and tailored sampling methods. Together, these developments are beginning to enable the steering of generative models toward proteins with desired, and often previously inaccessible, properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u4f46\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u539f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\u6216\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u548c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u91cd\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u4f46\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6216\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u59cb\u80fd\u591f\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6240\u9700\u4e14\u4ee5\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u6216\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}
