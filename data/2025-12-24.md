Abstract: RNA molecules are known to form complex secondary structures including pseudoknots. A systematic framework for the enumeration, classification and prediction of secondary structures is critical to determine the biological significance of the molecular configurations of RNA. Chord diagrams are mathematical objects widely used to represent RNA secondary structures and to analyze structural motifs, however a mathematically rigorous enumeration of pseudoknots remains a challenge. We introduce a method that incorporates a distance-based metric $τ$ to analyze the intersection graph of a chord diagram associated with a pseudoknotted structure. In particular, our method formally defines a pseudoknot in terms of a weighted vertex cover of a certain intersection graph constructed from a partition of the chord diagram representing the nucleotide sequence of the RNA molecule. In this graph-theoretic context, we introduce a rigorous algorithm that enumerates pseudoknots, classifies secondary structures, and is sensitive to three-dimensional topological features. We implement our methods in MATLAB and test the algorithm on pseudoknotted structures from the bpRNA-1m database. Our findings confirm that genus is a robust quantifier of pseudoknot complexity.

Abstract: Drug discovery has long sought computational systems capable of designing drug-like molecules directly: developable and non-immunogenic from the start. Here we introduce Latent-X2, a frontier generative model that achieves this goal through zero-shot design of antibodies with strong binding affinities, drug-like properties, and, for the first time for any de novo generated antibody, confirmed low immunogenicity in human donor panels. Latent-X2 is an all-atom model conditioned on target structure, epitope specification, and optional antibody framework, jointly generating sequences and structures while modelling the bound complex. Testing only 4 to 24 designs per target in each modality, we successfully generated VHH and scFv antibodies against 9 of 18 evaluated targets, achieving a 50% target-level success rate with picomolar to nanomolar binding affinities. Designed molecules exhibit developability profiles that match or exceed those of approved antibody therapeutics, including expression yield, aggregation propensity, polyreactivity, hydrophobicity, and thermal stability, without optimization, filtering, or selection. In the first immunogenicity assessment of any AI-generated antibody, representative de novo VHH binders targeting TNFL9 exhibit both potent target engagement and low immunogenicity across T-cell proliferation and cytokine release assays. The model generalizes beyond antibodies: against K-Ras, long considered undruggable, we generated macrocyclic peptide binders competitive with trillion-scale mRNA display screens. These properties emerge directly from the model, demonstrating the therapeutic viability of zero-shot molecular design, now available without AI infrastructure or coding expertise at https://platform.latentlabs.com.

Abstract: The function of RNA molecules is deeply related to their secondary structure, which determines which nucleobases are accessible for pairing. Most RNA molecules however function through dynamic and heterogeneous structural ensembles. Chemical probing methods (e.g., DMS probing) rely on selective chemical modification of accessible RNA nucleotides to infer base-pairing status, yet the resulting nucleotide-resolution data represent ensemble averages over dynamic RNA conformations. We present MERGE-RNA, a unified, physics-based framework that explicitly models the full experimental pipeline, from the thermodynamics of probe binding to the mutational profiling readout. By integrating measurements across probe concentrations and replicates, our model learns a small set of transferable and interpretable parameters together with minimal sequence-specific soft constraints. This enables the prediction of secondary structure ensembles that best explain the data and the detection of suboptmal structures involved in dynamic processes. We validate MERGE-RNA on diverse RNAs, showing that it achieves strong structural accuracy while preserving essential conformational heterogeneity. In a designed RNA for which we report new DMS data, MERGE-RNA detects transient intermediate states associated with strand displacement, dynamics that remain invisible to traditional methods.
