Despite its wide utility, RMSD calculation is\noften challenged by inconsistent atom ordering, indistinguishable\nconfigurations in molecular clusters, and potential chirality inversion during\nalignment. These issues highlight the necessity of accurate atom-to-atom\ncorrespondence as a prerequisite for meaningful alignment. Traditional\napproaches often rely on heuristic cost matrices combined with the Hungarian\nalgorithm, yet these methods underutilize the rich intra-molecular structural\ninformation and may fail to generalize across chemically diverse systems. In\nthis work, we introduce OTMol, a method that formulates the molecular alignment\ntask as a fused supervised Gromov-Wasserstein (fsGW) optimal transport problem.\nBy leveraging the intrinsic geometric and topological relationships within each\nmolecule, OTMol eliminates the need for manually defined cost functions and\nenables a principled, data-driven matching strategy. Importantly, OTMol\npreserves key chemical features such as molecular chirality and bond\nconnectivity consistency. We evaluate OTMol across a wide range of molecular\nsystems, including Adenosine triphosphate, Imatinib, lipids, small peptides,\nand water clusters, and demonstrate that it consistently achieves low RMSD\nvalues while preserving computational efficiency. Importantly, OTMol maintains\nmolecular integrity by enforcing one-to-one mappings between entire molecules,\nthereby avoiding erroneous many-to-one alignments that often arise in comparing\nmolecular clusters.
