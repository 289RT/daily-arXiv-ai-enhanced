Accurate\nidentification of this small yet critical region can accelerate the development\nof therapeutic antibodies. Determining paratope locations typically relies on\nmodeling the antibody structure, which is computationally intensive and\ndifficult to scale across large antibody repertoires. We introduce Paraplume, a\nsequence-based paratope prediction method that leverages embeddings from\nprotein language models (PLMs), without the need for structural input and\nachieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks compared to current\nmethods. In addition, reweighting PLM embeddings using Paraplume predictions\nyields more informative sequence representations, improving downstream tasks\nsuch as affinity prediction, binder classification, and epitope binning.\nApplied to large antibody repertoires, Paraplume reveals that antigen-specific\nsomatic hypermutations are associated with larger paratopes, suggesting a\npotential mechanism for affinity enhancement. Our findings position PLM-based\nparatope prediction as a powerful, scalable alternative to structure-dependent\napproaches, opening new avenues for understanding antibody evolution."}
