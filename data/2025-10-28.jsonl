Generative\nAI models have emerged as powerful tools for molecular design, yet most remain\nspecialized for individual molecular types and lack fine-grained control over\ninteraction details. Here we present ODesign, an all-atom generative world\nmodel for all-to-all biomolecular interaction design. ODesign allows scientists\nto specify epitopes on arbitrary targets and generate diverse classes of\nbinding partners with fine-grained control. Across entity-, token-, and\natom-level benchmarks in the protein modality, ODesign demonstrates superior\ncontrollability and performance to modality-specific baselines. Extending\nbeyond proteins, it generalizes to nucleic acid and small-molecule design,\nenabling interaction types such as protein-binding RNA/DNA and RNA/DNA-binding\nligands that were previously inaccessible. By unifying multimodal biomolecular\ninteractions within a single generative framework, ODesign moves toward a\ngeneral-purpose molecular world model capable of programmable design.

In this study, we identify VPS39, a core\ncomponent of the HOPS complex, as a molecular switch coordinating these\nprocesses. Genetic ablation of VPS39 not only impairs autophagic flux but also\ntriggers cell migration through RhoA/Rac1 GTPases upregulation, consequently\nfacilitating migrasome formation. Using super-resolution microscopy, we further\ndemonstrate that migrasomes serve as an alternative disposal route for damaged\nmitochondria during VPS39-induced autophagy impairment, revealing a novel\nstress adaptation mechanism. Our work establishes a previously unrecognized\nautophagy-migrasome axis and provides direct visual evidence of organelle\nquality control via migrasomal extrusion. These findings position\nVPS39-regulated pathway switching as a potential therapeutic strategy for\nneurodegenerative diseases characterized by autophagy dysfunction."}

In \\textit{Symbolic Neural\nGenerators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of\nfeasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each\nspecification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a\nneural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic\nspecification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the\ncomplementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG\nis a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible\ninstances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that\nsatisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics\nfor such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \\textit{base} and\n\\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,\nand outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In\nthis extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We\nimplement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming\n(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug\ndesign. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor\nmolecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are\nwell understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to\nstate-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood\ntargets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading\nclinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as\npreliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for\nsynthesis and wet-lab testing."}
