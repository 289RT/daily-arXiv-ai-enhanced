Motivation: 超加工食品日益与健康问题（如肥胖、心血管疾病）相关，但其大规模分类和环境、过敏原影响的系统性研究较少。

Method: 利用Open Food Facts数据集（超90万产品），训练LightGBM、Random Forest等模型，基于营养成分数据分类食品加工级别（NOVA）。

Result: LightGBM准确率达80-85%，高加工级别食品营养质量更低、碳排放更高且含更多添加剂和过敏原（如麸质、牛奶）。

Conclusion: 研究证实超加工食品的多重负面影响，并展示了机器学习在大规模分类中的实用性，提供了在线预测工具。

Abstract: Ultra-processed foods are increasingly linked to health issues like obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and mental health disorders due to poor nutritional quality. This first-of-its-kind study at such a scale uses machine learning to classify food processing levels (NOVA) based on the Open Food Facts dataset of over 900,000 products. Models including LightGBM, Random Forest, and CatBoost were trained on nutrient concentration data. LightGBM performed best, achieving 80-85% accuracy across different nutrient panels and effectively distinguishing minimally from ultra-processed foods. Exploratory analysis revealed strong associations between higher NOVA classes and lower Nutri-Scores, indicating poorer nutritional quality. Products in NOVA 3 and 4 also had higher carbon footprints and lower Eco-Scores, suggesting greater environmental impact. Allergen analysis identified gluten and milk as common in ultra-processed items, posing risks to sensitive individuals. Categories like Cakes and Snacks were dominant in higher NOVA classes, which also had more additives, highlighting the role of ingredient modification. This study, leveraging the largest dataset of NOVA-labeled products, emphasizes the health, environmental, and allergenic implications of food processing and showcases machine learning's value in scalable classification. A user-friendly web tool is available for NOVA prediction using nutrient data: https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/foodlabel/.

TL;DR: SimBinder-IF通过优化ESM-IF模型的解码器，显著提高了抗体结合亲和力的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗体亲和力优化方法效率低且计算成本高，SimBinder-IF旨在通过优化预训练模型ESM-IF的解码器来高效生成高亲和力抗体序列。

Method: 利用偏好优化方法训练ESM-IF模型的解码器，同时冻结结构编码器，以偏好实验验证的高亲和力抗体。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SimBinder-IF显著提高了结合亲和力的预测准确性和零样本泛化能力，同时参数效率更高。

Conclusion: SimBinder-IF是一种高效且参数优化的方法，可用于生成高亲和力抗体序列。

Abstract: Motivation: The clinical efficacy of antibody therapeutics critically depends on high-affinity target engagement, yet laboratory affinity-maturation campaigns are slow and costly. In computational settings, most protein language models (PLMs) are not trained to favor high-affinity antibodies, and existing preference optimization approaches introduce substantial computational overhead without clear affinity gains. Therefore, this work proposes SimBinder-IF, which converts the inverse folding model ESM-IF into an antibody sequence generator by freezing its structure encoder and training only its decoder to prefer experimentally stronger binders through preference optimization.
  Results: On the 11-assay AbBiBench benchmark, SimBinder-IF achieves a 55 percent relative improvement in mean Spearman correlation between log-likelihood scores and experimentally measured binding affinity compared to vanilla ESM-IF (from 0.264 to 0.410). In zero-shot generalization across four unseen antigen-antibody complexes, the correlation improves by 156 percent (from 0.115 to 0.294). SimBinder-IF also outperforms baselines in top-10 precision for ten-fold or greater affinity improvements. A case study redesigning antibody F045-092 for A/California/04/2009 (pdmH1N1) shows that SimBinder-IF proposes variants with substantially lower predicted binding free energy changes than ESM-IF (mean Delta Delta G -75.16 vs -46.57). Notably, SimBinder-IF trains only about 18 percent of the parameters of the full ESM-IF model, highlighting its parameter efficiency for high-affinity antibody generation.
