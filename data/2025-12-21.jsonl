We present a method based on a neural extension of compressed sensing to function space. We measure the activity of multiple different molecules simultaneously, rather than individually. Then, we deconvolute the molecule-activity map during model training. Co-design of wet lab experiments and learning algorithms provably leads to orders-of-magnitude gains in information density. We demonstrate on antibodies and cell therapies."}
