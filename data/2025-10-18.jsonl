While large language models\n(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in\nnatural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these\nmodifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like\nSMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by\ntranslating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular\noptimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable\nediting intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating\nthose intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our\napproach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits\nderived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On\ndownstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and\ntarget activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage\npoints to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines\nwhile preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,\nMECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,\nlaying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative\nhuman-AI workflows in drug discovery."}
