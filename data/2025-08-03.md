Abstract: This piece serves two purposes. Firstly, it aims at elucidating the role of
epistasis in shaping, at a molecular level, the evolutionary paths of proteins,
as well as the extent to which these epistatic effects are the outcome of an
as-yet-unidentified epistatic force. Second, it seeks to ascertain the extent
to which the principle of least action will enable us to identify which of all
potential trajectories has the highest evolutionary efficiency, as well as how
variations in factors such as protein robustness and folding rates, resulting
from the unavoidability of destabilizing mutations, might influence this
critical evolutionary process. The initial findings suggest that protein
evolution, at a molecular level, may be more predictable than previously
thought, as epistasis and the principle of least action collectively impose
constraints on evolutionary paths and trajectories, and consequently, on
protein evolvability. Thus, this work should advance our understanding of the
main molecular mechanisms that underlie the evolution of mutation-driven
proteins and also provide grounds to answer a fundamental evolutionary
question: how does Darwinian selection regard all potential trajectories
available?
