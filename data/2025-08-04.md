Abstract: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological
processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic
pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to
the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus,
neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable.
Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy
surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to
generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions
in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection.
Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large
datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural
network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT
PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE
consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction,
achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT
barrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into
large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted
barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in
peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance
trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials
with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is
generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate
simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.
