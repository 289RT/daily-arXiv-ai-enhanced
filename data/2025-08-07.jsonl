To explore the\nopportunities offered by deep learning to address this problem, we introduce a\nMolecular Dynamics Large Language Model (MD-LLM) framework to illustrate how\nLLMs can be leveraged to learn protein dynamics and discover states not seen in\ntraining. By applying MD-LLM-1, the first implementation of this approach,\nobtained by fine-tuning Mistral 7B, to the T4 lysozyme and Mad2 protein\nsystems, we show that training on one conformational state enables the\nprediction of other conformational states. These results indicate that MD-LLM-1\ncan learn the principles for the exploration of the conformational landscapes\nof proteins, although it is not yet modeling explicitly their thermodynamics\nand kinetics."}
