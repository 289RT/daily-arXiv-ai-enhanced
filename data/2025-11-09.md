Motivation: 研究旨在澄清亨廷顿病中神经元死亡的机制，尤其是蛋白质聚集体稳定的化学键类型，这对开发有效疗法至关重要。

Method: 通过细胞培养模型分析蛋白质聚集的稳定机制，重点关注氢键和共价键的作用。

Result: 细胞培养模型中，聚集主要由氢键稳定，但共价键也可能存在。患者脑中的机制尚不明确。

Conclusion: 明确蛋白质聚集体稳定的键类型是关键，将直接影响亨廷顿病的治疗策略。

Abstract: The presence of an expanded polyglutamine produces a toxic gain of function
in huntingtin. Protein aggregation resulting from this gain of function is
likely to be the cause of neuronal death. Two main mechanisms of aggregation
have been proposed: hydrogen bonding by polar-zipper formation and covalent
bonding by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. In cell culture models of
Huntington's disease, aggregates are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but
covalent bonds are also likely to occur. Nothing is known about the nature of
the bonds that stabilize the aggregates in the brain of patients with
Huntington's disease. It seems that the nature of the bond stabilizing the
aggregates is one of the most important questions, as the answer would
condition the therapeutic approach to Huntington's disease.

### [2] [Enhancing Multimodal Protein Function Prediction Through Dual-Branch Dynamic Selection with Reconstructive Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04040)
*Xiaoling Luo,Peng Chen,Chengliang Liu,Xiaopeng Jin,Jie Wen,Yumeng Liu,Junsong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态蛋白质功能预测方法（DSRPGO），通过动态选择和重构预训练机制，结合双向交互模块（BInM）和多级特征选择模块（DSM），显著提升了预测性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态蛋白质特征涵盖广泛信息，但其复杂关联难以解析，需要一种新方法来整合和利用这些特征以提高功能预测准确性。

Method: 提出DSRPGO模型：1）采用重构预训练挖掘细粒度低语义信息；2）使用双向交互模块（BInM）促进多模态特征交互学习；3）设计动态选择模块（DSM）选择最优特征表示。

Result: DSRPGO在人类数据集上BPO、MFO和CCO指标显著提升，优于其他基准模型。

Conclusion: DSRPGO通过动态选择和交互学习多模态特征，有效提升了蛋白质功能预测性能。

Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function
prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information,
ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and
interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex
interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function
prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive
pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce
reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low
semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module
(BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features.
Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label
classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to
select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein
function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO,
MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.
