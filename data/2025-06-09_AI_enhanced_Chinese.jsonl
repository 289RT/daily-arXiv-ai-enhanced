However, the molecular determinants\nunderlying binding affinity are still not fully understood. In particular, the\nentropic contributions, especially those arising from conformational dynamics,\nremain poorly characterized. In this study, we explore the relationship between\nprotein motion and binding stability and its role in protein function. To gain\ndeeper insight into how protein complexes modulate their stability, we\ninvestigated a model system with a well-characterized and fast evolutionary\nhistory: a set of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants bound to the human ACE2\nreceptor, for which experimental binding affinity data are available. Through\nMolecular Dynamics simulations, we analyzed both structural and dynamical\ndifferences between the unbound (apo) and bound (holo) forms of the spike\nprotein across several variants of concern. Our findings indicate that a more\nstable binding is associated with proteins that exhibit higher rigidity in\ntheir unbound state and display dynamical patterns similar to that observed\nafter binding to ACE2. The increase of binding stability is not the sole\ndriving force of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. More recent variants are characterized\nby a more dynamical behavior that determines a less efficient viral entry but\ncould optimize other traits, such as antibody escape. These results suggest\nthat to fully understand the strength of the binding between two proteins, the\nstability of the two isolated partners should be investigated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u7ed3\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86SARS-CoV-2\u523a\u7a81\u86cb\u767d\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0eACE2\u53d7\u4f53\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u672a\u7ed3\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u521a\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u590d\u5408\u7269\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6784\u8c61\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u71b5\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u4e2aSARS-CoV-2\u523a\u7a81\u86cb\u767d\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u672a\u7ed3\u5408\uff08apo\uff09\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\uff08holo\uff09\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0e\u672a\u7ed3\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u521a\u6027\u53ca\u4e0e\u7ed3\u5408\u540e\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\uff1bSARS-CoV-2\u8fdb\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7531\u7ed3\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd8\u6d89\u53ca\u6297\u4f53\u9003\u9038\u7b49\u5176\u4ed6\u6027\u72b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b8c\u5168\u7406\u89e3\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u95f4\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5b64\u7acb\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

We evaluated our method on a newly curated\nbenchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment\nfactor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong\nperformance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our\napproach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios\nlacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\uff08VS\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728apo\u6216\u9884\u6d4b\u86cb\u767d\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u5bcc\u96c6\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56holo\u86cb\u767d\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\uff0capo\u6216\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u53e3\u888b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u5408\u5019\u9009\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728apo\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEF1%\u4ece11.75\u63d0\u5347\u81f337.19\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728holo\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4ecd\u7136\u5f3a\u52b2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u86cb\u767d-\u914d\u4f53\u590d\u5408\u7269\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u9996\u521b\u65b0\u836f\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}
