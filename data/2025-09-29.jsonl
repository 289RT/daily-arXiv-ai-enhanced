While cell-free transcription-translation systems\nsimplify and open up cellular biochemistry for manipulation, microfluidics\nenables miniaturisation and precise control over geometries and reaction\nconditions. In this review, we highlight the benefits of combining\nmicrofluidics with CFE reactions for the study and engineering of molecular\nfunctions and the construction of life-like systems from non-living components.\nBy defining spatial organisation at different scales and sustaining\nnon-equilibrium conditions, microfluidic environments play a key role in the\nquest to boot up the biochemistry of life."}

While\nElectroencephalography (EEG) based machine learning (ML) models can be used to\nthis end, their high computational cost hinders embedded real-time\napplications. Hardware implementations of spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer\na promising alternative for low-power, fast, event-driven processing. This\nstudy compares hardware compatible SNN models with various traditional ML ones,\nusing an open-source multimodal dataset. Our results show that multimodal\nintegration improves accuracy, with SNN performance comparable to the ML one,\ndemonstrating their potential for real-time implementations of cognitive load\ndetection. These findings position event-based processing as a promising\nsolution for low-latency, energy efficient workload monitoring in adaptive\nclosed-loop embedded devices that dynamically regulate cognitive load."}
