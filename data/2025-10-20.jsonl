However, existing approaches observe critical failure modes when precise\nconstraints are necessary for functional design. To this end, we present a\nconstrained diffusion framework for structure-guided protein design, ensuring\nstrict adherence to functional requirements while maintaining precise\nstereochemical and geometric feasibility. The approach integrates proximal\nfeasibility updates with ADMM decomposition into the generative process,\nscaling effectively to the complex constraint sets of this domain. We evaluate\non challenging protein design tasks, including motif scaffolding and\nvacancy-constrained pocket design, while introducing a novel curated benchmark\ndataset for motif scaffolding in the PDZ domain. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art, providing perfect satisfaction of bonding and geometric\nconstraints with no degradation in structural diversity."}
