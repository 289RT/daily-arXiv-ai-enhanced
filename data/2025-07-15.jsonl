To guarantee robust scalability, we\nestablish a predictive scaling law and reveal the progressive emergence of\nstructural understanding via loss perspective, culminating in a strong\n1.7-billion model. Building on this foundation, we devise a multiple sequence\nalignment (MSA)-based in-context learning strategy to unify protein design into\na general framework, where AMix-1 recognizes deep evolutionary signals among\nMSAs and consistently generates structurally and functionally coherent\nproteins. This framework enables the successful design of a dramatically\nimproved AmeR variant with an up to $50\\times$ activity increase over its wild\ntype. Pushing the boundaries of protein engineering, we further empower AMix-1\nwith an evolutionary test-time scaling algorithm for in silico directed\nevolution that delivers substantial, scalable performance gains as verification\nbudgets are intensified, laying the groundwork for next-generation\nlab-in-the-loop protein design."}

While recent methods have\nimproved prediction accuracy through extensive sampling, aimless sampling often\nprovides diminishing returns due to limited conformational diversity. Here, we\nintroduce HelixFold-S1, a contact-guided sampling strategy that improves\nstructural accuracy. Rather than relying on indiscriminate sampling,\nHelixFold-S1 predicts contact probabilities between molecular entities and uses\nthese predictions to prioritize sampling of likely binding sites and modes.\nThis targeted approach generates a diverse set of structural candidates,\nenhancing the likelihood of identifying accurate conformations. We demonstrate\nthat HelixFold-S1 consistently outperforms baseline sampling strategies across\na range of biomolecular interactions, including protein-antibody,\nprotein-protein, protein-ligand, protein-RNA, and protein-DNA interfaces.\nFurthermore, the predicted contact probabilities serve as a reliable indicator\nof structural difficulty, guiding the allocation of sampling resources.

However,\nthe conformational flexibility of both proteins and ligands challenges\nconventional rigid docking methods that assume a fixed receptor structure. In\nthis study, we examined the impact of conformational diversity on binding\nenergy calculations using 79 HIV-1 protease-ligand complexes. Molecular\ndynamics simulations were employed to generate structural ensembles for both\nproteins and ligands in aqueous environments. RMSD-based clustering was applied\nto reduce redundancy while preserving structural diversity. Binding energies\nwere computed using van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. The results\ndemonstrated that native protein-ligand pairs consistently yielded favorable\nbinding energies, whereas non-native pairings often failed to reproduce\nbinding. Furthermore, clustering thresholds influenced the balance between\ncomputational cost and interaction accuracy. These findings underscore the\nimportance of incorporating multiple protein and ligand conformations in SBVS\nprotocols to improve prediction reliability and support more effective drug\ndiscovery strategies."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce ToxBench,\nthe first large-scale AB-FEP dataset designed for ML development and focused on\na single pharmaceutically critical target, Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha\n(ER$\\alpha$). ToxBench contains 8,770 ER$\\alpha$-ligand complex structures with\nbinding free energies computed via AB-FEP with a subset validated against\nexperimental affinities at 1.75 kcal/mol RMSE, along with non-overlapping\nligand splits to assess model generalizability.

We present SAFE-T, a generalist chemical\nmodeling framework that conditions on biological context -- such as protein\ntargets or mechanisms of action -- to prioritize and design molecules without\nrelying on structural information or engineered scoring functions. SAFE-T\nmodels the conditional likelihood of fragment-based molecular sequences given a\nbiological prompt, enabling principled scoring of molecules across tasks such\nas virtual screening, drug-target interaction prediction, and activity cliff\ndetection. Moreover, it supports goal-directed generation by sampling from this\nlearned distribution, aligning molecular design with biological objectives. In\ncomprehensive zero-shot evaluations across predictive (LIT-PCBA, DAVIS, KIBA,\nACNet) and generative (DRUG, PMO) benchmarks, SAFE-T consistently achieves\nperformance comparable to or better than existing approaches while being\nsignificantly faster. Fragment-level attribution further reveals that SAFE-T\ncaptures known structure-activity relationships, supporting interpretable and\nbiologically grounded design. Together with its computational efficiency, these\nresults demonstrate that conditional generative CLMs can unify scoring and\ngeneration to accelerate early-stage drug discovery."}
