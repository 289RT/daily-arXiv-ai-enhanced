  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决LLMs在分子优化中执行修改不精准的问题，尤其是在非直观表示（如SMILES）上的操作。

Method: MECo将分子优化任务拆分为生成人类可理解的编辑意图和通过代码生成执行结构修改的两步框架。

Result: MECo在保留结构相似性的同时，实现了98%的编辑准确性和38-86个百分点的性能提升，下游任务成功率高于基线方法。

Conclusion: MECo通过意图与执行的结合，实现了可控、可解释的分子设计，为药物发现中的人机协作奠定了基础。

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires
precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in
natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.
