Here, employing a custom interpretable deep learning framework (CARSS) on single-cell RNA sequencing data, we identify CD34$^{+}$PDGFR$α$$^{+}$ telocytes (CPTCs) as the primary mechanosensors in both fascia and colon during bacterial colitis. We show that somatic mechanotherapy triggers an AP-1/Hsp70-dependent transcriptional program in fascial CPTCs, inducing systemic Wnt elevation, which elicits a \"transcriptional resonance\" in colonic CPTCs, reprogramming their communication network from an inflammatory amplifier to a Wnt-driven regenerative hub. Mechanistically, this axis activates epithelial $β$-catenin/Myc signaling, suppressing apoptosis and restoring barrier integrity independent of immune cells. Our findings define a CPTC-Driven Mechano-Resonance Axis, where CPTCs serve as synchronized relay stations that convert local mechanical cues into systemic regenerative microenvironments."}
