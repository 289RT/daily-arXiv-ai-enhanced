Simulating HAT is challenging due to\nthe need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus,\nneither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable.\nMachine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy\nsurfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to\ngeneralize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions\nin proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection.\nHere, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large\ndatasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural\nnetwork architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT\nPESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE\nconsistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction,\nachieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT\nbarrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into\nlarge-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted\nbarriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in\npeptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance\ntrade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials\nwith transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is\ngeneralizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate\nsimulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments."}
