Motivation: 探索蛋白质-核酸混合物中多种物理相互作用（尤其是静电和碱基配对）如何共同影响相行为，解决这些相互作用可能互补或拮抗的问题。

Method: 结合实验和理论，研究聚-L-赖氨酸（PLL）和自互补DNA纳米星（NS）在不同温度、离子强度和组成下的相行为。

Result: 发现静电和碱基配对在高离子强度和高温度下协同稳定相分离，形成两相或三相共存，并观察到多种动力学路径形成的非平衡聚集体或液滴。

Conclusion: 不同相互作用模式的协同可以显著增加相行为的复杂性，为设计多相凝聚体提供了新思路。

Abstract: Phase separation in biomolecular mixtures can result from multiple physical
interactions, which may act either complementarily or antagonistically. In the
case of protein--nucleic acid mixtures, charge plays a key role but can have
contrasting effects on phase behavior. Attractive electrostatic interactions
between oppositely charged macromolecules are screened by added salt, reducing
the driving force for coacervation. By contrast, base-pairing interactions
between nucleic acids are diminished by charge repulsion and thus enhanced by
added salt, promoting associative phase separation. To explore this interplay,
we combine experiment and theory to map the complex phase behavior of a model
solution of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and self-complementary DNA nanostars (NS) as a
function of temperature, ionic strength, and macromolecular composition.
Despite having opposite salt dependences, we find that electrostatics and base
pairing cooperate to stabilize NS--PLL coacervation at high ionic strengths and
temperatures, leading to two-phase or three-phase coexistence under various
conditions. We further observe a variety of kinetic pathways to phase
separation at different salt concentrations, resulting in the formation of
nonequilibrium aggregates or droplets whose compositions evolve on long
timescales. Finally, we show that the cooperativity between electrostatics and
base pairing can be used to create multiphase coacervates that partition
various NS species at intermediate salt concentrations. Our results illustrate
how the interplay between distinct interaction modes can greatly increase the
complexity of the phase behavior relative to systems with a single type of
interaction.
