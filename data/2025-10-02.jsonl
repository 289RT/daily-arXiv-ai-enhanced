Current AI paradigms present a\ntrade-off: Protein Language Models (PLMs) capture evolutionary statistics but\nlack explicit physical grounding, while generative models trained to model full\nensembles are computationally expensive. In this work we critically assess\nthese limits and propose a path forward. We introduce GeoGraph, a\nsimulation-informed surrogate trained to predict ensemble-averaged statistics\nof residue-residue contact-map topology directly from sequence. By featurizing\ncoarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations into residue- and sequence-level\ngraph descriptors, we create a robust and information-rich learning target. Our\nevaluation demonstrates that this approach yields representations that are more\npredictive of key biophysical properties than existing methods."}

While these provide us\nwith invaluable insights, they do not directly reveal that molecules are\ninherently dynamic. Advances in time-dependent and time-resolved experimental\nmethods have made it possible to capture the dynamics of biomolecules at\nincreasingly higher spatial and temporal resolutions. To complement these,\ncomputational models can represent the structural and dynamical behaviour of\nbiomolecules at atomistic resolution and femtosecond timescale, and are\ntherefore useful to interpret these experiments. Here, we review the progress\nin integrating simulations with dynamical experiments, focusing on the\ncombination of simulations with time-resolved and time-dependent experimental\ndata."}
