Abstract: The rapid expansion of enzyme kinetics literature has outpaced the curation
capabilities of major biochemical databases, creating a substantial barrier to
AI-driven modeling and knowledge discovery. We present zERExtractor, an
automated and extensible platform for comprehensive extraction of
enzyme-catalyzed reaction and activity data from scientific literature.
zERExtractor features a unified, modular architecture that supports
plug-and-play integration of state-of-the-art models, including large language
models (LLMs), as interchangeable components, enabling continuous system
evolution alongside advances in AI. Our pipeline combines domain-adapted deep
learning, advanced OCR, semantic entity recognition, and prompt-driven LLM
modules, together with human expert corrections, to extract kinetic parameters
(e.g., kcat, Km), enzyme sequences, substrate SMILES, experimental conditions,
and molecular diagrams from heterogeneous document formats. Through active
learning strategies integrating AI-assisted annotation, expert validation, and
iterative refinement, the system adapts rapidly to new data sources. We also
release a large benchmark dataset comprising over 1,000 annotated tables and
5,000 biological fields from 270 P450-related enzymology publications.
Benchmarking demonstrates that zERExtractor consistently outperforms existing
baselines in table recognition (Acc 89.9%), molecular image interpretation (up
to 99.1%), and relation extraction (accuracy 94.2%). zERExtractor bridges the
longstanding data gap in enzyme kinetics with a flexible, plugin-ready
framework and high-fidelity extraction, laying the groundwork for future
AI-powered enzyme modeling and biochemical knowledge discovery.

TL;DR: HelixVS是一种基于深度学习的虚拟筛选平台，显著提高了虚拟筛选的性能和效率，适用于多种药物开发流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟筛选（VS）可以有效降低药物发现的成本和周期，但如何在大规模化合物库中高效筛选仍是挑战。HelixVS旨在通过深度学习方法提高虚拟筛选的准确性和速度。

Method: HelixVS集成了基于深度学习的姿态评分模型和多阶段虚拟筛选模块，优化了活性化合物的筛选过程。

Conclusion: HelixVS能够高效识别高亲和力配体，适用于多种靶点类型，其公开版本有望加速药物开发进程。

Abstract: Drug discovery through virtual screening (VS) has become a popular strategy
for identifying hits against protein targets. VS has the potential to reduce
the cost and time needed for manual selection and wet-laboratory experiments.
Improving the cost-effectiveness of virtual screening is a significant
challenge, aiming to explore larger compound libraries while maintaining lower
screening costs. Here, we present HelixVS, a structure-based VS platform
enhanced by deep learning models. HelixVS integrates a precise deep
learning-based pose-scoring model and a pose-screening module into a
multi-stage VS process, enabling more effective screening of active compounds.
Compared to classic molecular docking tools like Vina, HelixVS demonstrated
significantly improved screening performance across nearly a hundred targets,
achieving an average 2.6-fold higher enrichment factor (EF) and more than 10
times faster screening speed. We applied HelixVS in four drug development
pipelines, targeting both traditional competitive drug-binding pockets and
novel protein-protein interaction interfaces. Wet-lab validations across these
pipelines consistently identified active compounds, with over 10% of the
molecules tested in wet labs demonstrating activity at uM or even nM levels.
This demonstrates the ability of HelixVS to identify high-affinity ligands for
various targets and pockets. Furthermore, we provide a publicly available and
free version of HelixVS with limited computing power to assist drug development
scientists in accelerating their drug discovery processes.

### [3] [FROGENT: An End-to-End Full-process Drug Design Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10760)
*Qihua Pan,Dong Xu,Jenna Xinyi Yao,Lijia Ma,Zexuan Zhu,Junkai Ji*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: FROGENT是一个基于大型语言模型的药物设计智能体，整合了动态生化数据库和任务专用AI模型，显著提升了药物发现的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前药物发现的AI工具分散且接口不兼容，导致科学家需要管理复杂的脚本和工具，效率低下。FROGENT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FROGENT利用大型语言模型和Model Context Protocol，整合动态生化数据库、可扩展工具库和任务专用AI模型，动态执行复杂药物发现流程。

Result: 在八个药物发现基准测试中，FROGENT性能显著优于基线模型，命中率提高三倍，交互分析性能翻倍，且优于GPT-4o等商业化模型。

Conclusion: FROGENT通过智能体框架显著提升了药物发现的生产力和效率，展现了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Powerful AI tools for drug discovery reside in isolated web apps, desktop
programs, and code libraries. Such fragmentation forces scientists to manage
incompatible interfaces and specialized scripts, which can be a cumbersome and
repetitive process. To address this issue, a Full-pROcess druG dEsign ageNT,
named FROGENT, has been proposed. Specifically, FROGENT utilizes a Large
Language Model and the Model Context Protocol to integrate multiple dynamic
biochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and task-specific AI models.
This agentic framework allows FROGENT to execute complicated drug discovery
workflows dynamically, including component tasks such as target identification,
molecule generation and retrosynthetic planning. FROGENT has been evaluated on
eight benchmarks that cover various aspects of drug discovery, such as
knowledge retrieval, property prediction, virtual screening, mechanistic
analysis, molecular design, and synthesis. It was compared against six
increasingly advanced ReAct-style agents that support code execution and
literature searches. Empirical results demonstrated that FROGENT triples the
best baseline performance in hit-finding and doubles it in interaction
profiling, significantly outperforming both the open-source model Qwen3-32B and
the commercial model GPT-4o. In addition, real-world cases have been utilized
to validate the practicability and generalization of FROGENT. This development
suggests that streamlining the agentic drug discovery pipeline can
significantly enhance researcher productivity.

Main category: cond-mat.soft

TL;DR: 论文研究了由分子马达驱动的细胞骨架细丝在表面螺旋运动的机理，重点分析了微管-动力蛋白系统的实验结果，发现螺旋频率与力密度的比例关系与之前理论预测不符；同时也提出了关于细丝长度对螺旋半径和频率的影响的新预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究背景是探索细胞骨架细丝在分子马达驱动下的螺旋运动机制，尤其是填补了理论预测与实验在微管-动力蛋白系统中的差距。

Method: 方法包括实验重建动力蛋白驱动的微管螺旋运动、理论分析和数值模拟，以验证螺旋半径和频率与力密度及细丝长度的关系。

Result: 结果显示螺旋半径的力密度依赖性符合预期，但频率的比例关系与理论预测（1/3而非4/3）不一致；同时提出了螺旋半径与细丝长度的比例关系和频率的反比关系，并通过可变持久长度模型解释了实验数据。

Conclusion: 研究结果通过综合理论、模拟和实验，深化了对细胞骨架细丝弹性、微管屈曲机制和主动运输物理原理的理解。

Abstract: Cytoskeletal filaments transported by surface immobilized molecular motors
with one end pinned to the surface have been observed to spiral in a
myosin-driven actin 'gliding assay'. The radius of the spiral was shown to
scale with motor density with an exponent of -1/3, while the frequency was
theoretically predicted to scale with an exponent of 4/3. While both the
spiraling radius and frequency depend on motor density, the theory assumed
independence of filament length, and remained to be tested on cytoskeletal
systems other than actin-myosin. Here, we reconstitute dynein-driven
microtubule spiraling and compare experiments to theory and numerical
simulations. We characterize the scaling laws of spiraling MTs and find the
radius dependence on force density to be consistent with previous results.
Frequency on the other hand scales with force density with an exponent of ~1/3,
contrary to previous predictions. We also predict that the spiral radius scales
proportionally and the frequency scales inversely with filament length, both
with an exponent of ~1/3. A model of variable persistence length best explains
the length dependence observed in experiments. Our findings that reconcile
theory, simulations, and experiments improve our understanding of the role of
cytoskeletal filament elasticity, mechanics of microtubule buckling and motor
transport and the physical principles of active filaments.

### [5] [IBEX: Information-Bottleneck-EXplored Coarse-to-Fine Molecular Generation under Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10775)
*Dong Xu,Zhangfan Yang,Jenna Xinyi Yao,Shuangbao Song,Zexuan Zhu,Junkai Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBEX提出了一种从粗到细的管道，利用信息瓶颈理论解决药物设计中蛋白配体复合物数据不足的问题，显著提升了零样本对接成功率和各项指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于公开的蛋白配体复合物数据稀缺，现有模型难以学习可转移的几何先验，容易过拟合，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: IBEX利用PAC-Bayesian信息瓶颈理论量化样本信息密度，结合Scaffold Hopping任务和L-BFGS优化步骤，生成并结合物理优化术语改进分子构象。

Result: IBEX将CBGBench CrossDocked2020上的零样本对接成功率从53%提升到64%，Vina评分从-7.41 kcal mol^-1提升到-8.07 kcal mol^-1，并在57/100口袋中取得最佳中值Vina能量。

Conclusion: IBEX通过信息瓶颈和物理优化，显著提升了药物设计中的生成性能和转移能力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.
