However, current experimental methods for\ndetermining VLP stoichiometry are labor-intensive, and time consuming. Machine\nlearning approaches have hardly been applied to the study of VLPs. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce a novel persistent Laplacian-based machine\nlearning (PLML) mode that leverages both harmonic and non-harmonic spectra to\ncapture intricate topological and geometric features of VLP structures. This\napproach achieves superior performance on the VLP200 dataset compared to\nexisting methods. To further assess robustness and generalizability, we\ncollected a new dataset, VLP706, containing 706 VLP samples with expanded\nstoichiometry diversity. Our PLML model maintains strong predictive accuracy on\nVLP706. Additionally, through random sequence perturbative mutation analysis,\nwe found that 60-mers and 180-mers exhibit greater stability than 240-mers and\n420-mers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u4e45\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08PLML\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u75c5\u6bd2\u6837\u9897\u7c92\uff08VLP\uff09\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u8ba1\u91cf\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u957f\u4e14\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728VLP\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6301\u4e45\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8c10\u6ce2\u548c\u975e\u8c10\u6ce2\u8c31\u6355\u6349VLP\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "PLML\u5728VLP200\u548cVLP706\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b060-mers\u548c180-mers\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "PLML\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316VLP\u7684\u7ec4\u88c5\u548c\u514d\u75ab\u539f\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
