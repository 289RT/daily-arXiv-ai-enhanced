These systems require models that can simultaneously\ncapture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across\nspatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure,\nsuch as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains.\nExisting geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either\nEuclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture\nboth the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware\ndependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large\nbiomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant\nNetwork that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and\nSpherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware\nfeatures. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a\nnovel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate\natomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling\nefficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems.\nDualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing\nbenchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms\nprior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating\nits broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks."}

In this work, we tackle three core\nchallenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2)\nscaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small\nfragment sets. We propose \\textbf{Recursive Cost Guidance}, a backward policy\nframework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate\nsynthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost\nsynthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular\ndiversity, and quality, especially when paired with an \\textbf{Exploitation\nPenalty} that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To\nenhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a\n\\textbf{Dynamic Library} mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states\nto construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art\nresults in template-based molecular generation."}

This can be\ncumbersome and error-prone when functional annotation, computation of\nphysico-chemical properties, and structure visualization are separated. To\naddress this, we introduce ProCaliper, an open-source Python library for\ncomputing and visualizing physico-chemical properties of proteins. It can\nretrieve annotation and structure data from UniProt and AlphaFold databases,\ncompute residue-level properties such as charge, solvent accessibility, and\nprotonation state, and interactively visualize the results of these\ncomputations along with user-supplied residue-level data. Additionally,\nProCaliper incorporates functional and structural information to construct and\noptionally sparsify networks that encode the distance between residues and/or\nannotated functional sites or regions. The package ProCaliper and its source\ncode, along with the code used to generate the figures in this manuscript, are\nfreely available at https://github.com/PNNL-Predictive-Phenomics/ProCaliper."}

We suggested that such quenching\nprocesses might have occurred at very high rates on early earth, giving an\nefficient mechanism for natural sorting through enormous numbers of\nnonequilibrium chemistries from which those most likely to lead to life could\nbe naturally selected. Taking account of kinetic barriers, we found good\nagreement between laboratory quenching experiments on solutions of amino acids\nand the resulting model. We also made a preliminary comparison between reported\ndata on polypeptides sampled from emissions from smokers near ocean ridges and\nour model. However that previous model assumed that the concentrations of all\nmonomeric amino acids in the medium were the same whereas that is not the case\nin samples taken from ocean smokers. Here we take account of the heterogeneous\nconcentrations of the amino acid monomers in the medium in the analysis of the\nsmoker data and compare the results with the data on polypeptide concentrations\nfound in the samples taken by a submersible in the Marianna Trough. Results are\nconsistent with the hypothesis that smokers were the source of large and\nextremely diverse number of polypeptides in thermal disequilibrium which could\nincubate processes leading to life."}

We\nintroduce PocketVina, a fast and memory-efficient, search-based docking\nframework that combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket\nexploration. We evaluate PocketVina across four established\nbenchmarks--PDBbind2020 (timesplit and unseen), DockGen, Astex, and\nPoseBusters--and observe consistently strong performance in sampling physically\nvalid docking poses. PocketVina achieves state-of-the-art performance when\njointly considering ligand RMSD and physical validity (PB-valid), while\nremaining competitive with deep learning-based approaches in terms of RMSD\nalone, particularly on structurally diverse and previously unseen targets.\nPocketVina also maintains state-of-the-art physically valid docking accuracy\nacross ligands with varying degrees of flexibility. We further introduce\nTargetDock-AI, a benchmarking dataset we curated, consisting of over 500000\nprotein-ligand pairs, and a partition of the dataset labeled with PubChem\nactivity annotations. On this large-scale dataset, PocketVina successfully\ndiscriminates active from inactive targets, outperforming a deep learning\nbaseline while requiring significantly less GPU memory and runtime. PocketVina\noffers a robust and scalable docking strategy that requires no task-specific\ntraining and runs efficiently on standard GPUs, making it well-suited for\nhigh-throughput virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery."}
