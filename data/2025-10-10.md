Motivation: 生物分子间的相互作用强度（如解离常数KD）在基础研究和药物开发中至关重要。传统方法如质谱技术在分析同源复合物时存在信号重叠的问题，影响了测量的准确性。

Method: 通过样品稀释和共价交联，分析每种寡聚物的电荷状态分布，从而区分单体和二聚体对重叠质谱峰的贡献。该方法采用了定量激光诱导液滴离子解吸质谱（qLILBID-MS）。

Result: qLILBID-MS成功测量了牛血清白蛋白和人致病性锥虫氧化还原酶的同源二聚体亲和力，并揭示了关键二聚体界面突变对亲和力的逐步降低效应。该方法比传统方法更节省样品且适用范围广。

Conclusion: qLILBID-MS是一种灵敏、快速、经济和可扩展的蛋白质相互作用定量方法，有望加速药物发现工作流程，特别是在筛选接近诱导分子（如PROTACs和分子胶）方面。

Abstract: Biological processes rely on finely tuned homo- and heteromeric interactions
between (biomacro)molecules. The strength of an interaction, typically given by
the dissociation constant (KD), plays a crucial role in basic research and must
be monitored throughout the development of drugs and agrochemicals. An ideal
method for KD determination is applicable to various analytes with a large
range of affinities, tolerates complex matrix compositions, does not require
labeling, and simultaneously provides information on the structural integrity
of the binding partners. Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but
typically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass
signals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to
overlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of
each oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking.
Following this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead
Ion Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the
affinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of
Tryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei
parasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities. Conveniently,
qLILBID-MS requires a fraction of sample used by other methods such as
isothermal titration calorimetry and yields previously inaccessible protein
homodimer KDs in the high micromolar range, which allowed us to monitor the
gradual decrease in homodimer affinity via mutation of crucial dimer interface
contacts. Overall, qLILBID-MS is a sensitive, robust, fast, scalable, and
cost-effective alternative to quantify protein/protein interactions that can
accelerate contemporary drug discovery workflows, e.g. the efficient screening
for proximity inducing molecules like proteolysis targeting chimera and
molecular glues.
