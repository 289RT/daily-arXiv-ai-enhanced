Abstract: Polyphenols and proteins are essential biomolecules that influence food
functionality and, by extension, human health. Their interactions -- hereafter
referred to as PhPIs (polyphenol-protein interactions) -- affect key processes
such as nutrient bioavailability, antioxidant activity, and therapeutic
efficacy. However, these interactions remain challenging due to the structural
diversity of polyphenols and the dynamic nature of protein binding. Traditional
experimental techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass
spectrometry (MS), along with computational tools such as molecular docking and
molecular dynamics (MD), have offered important insights but face constraints
in scalability, throughput, and reproducibility. This review explores how deep
learning (DL) is reshaping the study of PhPIs by enabling efficient prediction
of binding sites, interaction affinities, and MD using high-dimensional bio-
and chem-informatics data. While DL enhances prediction accuracy and reduces
experimental redundancy, its effectiveness remains limited by data
availability, quality, and representativeness, particularly in the context of
natural products. We critically assess current DL frameworks for PhPIs analysis
and outline future directions, including multimodal data integration, improved
model generalizability, and development of domain-specific benchmark datasets.
This synthesis offers guidance for researchers aiming to apply DL in unraveling
structure-function relationships of polyphenols, accelerating discovery in
nutritional science and therapeutic development.
