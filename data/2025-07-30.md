Motivation: 现有实验方法耗时长且劳动密集，机器学习在VLP研究中应用不足。

Method: 利用持久拉普拉斯模型的谐波和非谐波谱捕捉VLP的拓扑和几何特征。

Result: PLML在VLP200和VLP706数据集上表现优异，发现60-mers和180-mers更稳定。

Conclusion: PLML为优化VLP的组装和免疫原性提供了新工具。

Abstract: Understanding the stoichiometry and associated stability of virus-like
particles (VLPs) is crucial for optimizing their assembly efficiency and
immunogenic properties, which are essential for advancing biotechnology,
vaccine design, and drug delivery. However, current experimental methods for
determining VLP stoichiometry are labor-intensive, and time consuming. Machine
learning approaches have hardly been applied to the study of VLPs. To address
this challenge, we introduce a novel persistent Laplacian-based machine
learning (PLML) mode that leverages both harmonic and non-harmonic spectra to
capture intricate topological and geometric features of VLP structures. This
approach achieves superior performance on the VLP200 dataset compared to
existing methods. To further assess robustness and generalizability, we
collected a new dataset, VLP706, containing 706 VLP samples with expanded
stoichiometry diversity. Our PLML model maintains strong predictive accuracy on
VLP706. Additionally, through random sequence perturbative mutation analysis,
we found that 60-mers and 180-mers exhibit greater stability than 240-mers and
420-mers.

TL;DR: DynamicMPNN是一种用于多状态蛋白质设计的新模型，通过联合学习构象集合，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统结构生物学假设蛋白质遵循‘一个序列、一个结构、一个功能’的范式，但许多生物过程需要蛋白质多构象状态。现有方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出DynamicMPNN模型，通过构象对的联合学习生成多构象兼容序列，训练集覆盖75% CATH超家族。

Result: DynamicMPNN在结构标准化的RMSD指标上比ProteinMPNN提升了13%。

Conclusion: DynamicMPNN为多状态蛋白质设计提供了更高效的工具，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Structural biology has long been dominated by the one sequence, one
structure, one function paradigm, yet many critical biological processes - from
enzyme catalysis to membrane transport - depend on proteins that adopt multiple
conformational states. Existing multi-state design approaches rely on post-hoc
aggregation of single-state predictions, achieving poor experimental success
rates compared to single-state design. We introduce DynamicMPNN, an inverse
folding model explicitly trained to generate sequences compatible with multiple
conformations through joint learning across conformational ensembles. Trained
on 46,033 conformational pairs covering 75% of CATH superfamilies and evaluated
using AlphaFold initial guess, DynamicMPNN outperforms ProteinMPNN by up to 13%
on structure-normalized RMSD across our challenging multi-state protein
benchmark.
