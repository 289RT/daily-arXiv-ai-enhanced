Abstract: Background: In the Nearest-Neighbor Thermodynamic Model, a standard approach
for RNA secondary structure prediction, the energy of the multiloops is modeled
using a linear entropic penalty governed by three branching parameters.
Although these parameters are typically fixed, recent work has shown that
reparametrizing the multiloop score and considering alternative branching
conformations can lead to significantly better structure predictions. However,
prior approaches for exploring the alternative branching structures were
computationally inefficient for long sequences.
  Results: We present a novel algorithm that partitions the parameter space,
identifying all distinct branching structures (optimal under different
branching parameters) for a given RNA sequence using the fewest possible
minimum free energy computations. Our method efficiently computes the full
parameter-space partition and the associated optimal structures, enabling a
comprehensive evaluation of the structural landscape across parameter choices.
We apply this algorithm to the Archive II benchmarking dataset, assessing the
maximum attainable prediction accuracy for each sequence under the
reparameterized multiloop model. We find that the potential for improvement
over default predictions is substantial in many cases, and that the optimal
prediction accuracy is highly sensitive to auxiliary modeling decisions, such
as the treatment of lonely base pairs and dangling ends.
  Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that the conventional choice
of multiloop parameters may limit prediction accuracy and that exploring
alternative parameterizations is both tractable and worthwhile. The efficient
partitioning algorithm we introduce makes this exploration feasible for longer
sequences and larger datasets. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges
in identifying the optimal structure.
