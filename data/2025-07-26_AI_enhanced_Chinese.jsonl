In this study, carbon\nnanoparticles (CNPs) were synthesized by the one-pot hydrothermal carbonization\n(HTC) using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Urea was used as the nitrogen source\nfor carbonization. The presence of urea in CMC solution for carbonization\nresulted in CNPsu reduction in the diameter of particles from 4 micrometer to 1\nmicrometer. Activation process at high temperature for both the above samples\nresulted in nanoparticles with diameter of 51 nm and 31 nm, respectively. The\npositive effect of presence urea and its activation generated different\nfunctional groups including C-N, N-H, and C -(triple bond)- N with increasing\naromatic rings that probably may help entrapment of drugs into them. On the\nother hand, activation CNPsu (ACNPsu) has the most aromatic rings with the\nlowest hydroxyl groups with 84.66% carbon and 12.29% oxygen in its structures.\nACNPs, and ACNPsu exhibited a type I isotherm indicating microporous materials\nwith a high surface area about 552.9 m2/g and 351.01 m2/g, respectively. The\nhigh surface area was characteristic of activated carbons with their high\nadsorption capacity. Thus, the synthesized materials were characterized using\nSEM, TEM, DLS, BET, FTIR, HNMR, and TGA techniques. Finally, the encapsulation\nof clindamycin drug (CD) with positive charge in different types of NPs with\nnegative charge was investigated for drug delivery in biomedical engineering\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u70ed\u78b3\u5316\u6cd5\u5236\u5907\u542b\u6c2e\u591a\u5b54\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u836f\u7269\u5c01\u88c5\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5b54\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\u5728\u836f\u7269\u4f20\u9012\u7b49\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u9505\u6c34\u70ed\u78b3\u5316\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u7fa7\u7532\u57fa\u7ea4\u7ef4\u7d20\u4e3a\u539f\u6599\uff0c\u5c3f\u7d20\u4e3a\u6c2e\u6e90\uff0c\u5236\u5907\u5e76\u6d3b\u5316\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u3002", "result": "\u6d3b\u5316\u540e\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u76f4\u5f84\u51cf\u5c0f\u81f331 nm\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u8868\u9762\u79ef\uff08351.01 m\u00b2/g\uff09\u548c\u5fae\u5b54\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u836f\u7269\u5c01\u88c5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u7684\u591a\u5b54\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u5728\u836f\u7269\u4f20\u9012\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

When analyzed\non 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more\ndiverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.\nMoreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot\ndesign tasks.
