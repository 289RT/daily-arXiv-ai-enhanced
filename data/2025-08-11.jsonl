This review\nexplores its role as a key fold model in protein design, particularly in\naddressing challenges in stabilization and functionalization. We discuss\nhistorical and recent advances in de novo TIM barrel design from the landmark\ncreation of sTIM11 to the development of the diversified variants, with a\nspecial focus on deepening our understanding of the determinants that modulate\nthe sequence-structure-function relationships of this architecture. Also, we\nexamine why the diversification of de novo TIM barrels towards\nfunctionalization remains a major challenge, given the absence of natural-like\nactive site features. Current approaches have focused on incorporating\nstructural extensions, modifying loops, and using cutting-edge AI-based\nstrategies to create scaffolds with tailored characteristics. Despite\nsignificant advances, achieving enzymatically active de novo TIM barrels has\nbeen proven difficult, with only recent breakthroughs demonstrating\nfunctionalized designs. We discuss the limitations of stepwise\nfunctionalization approaches and support an integrated approach that\nsimultaneously optimizes scaffold structure and active site shape, using both\nphysical- and AI-driven methods. By combining computational and experimental\ninsights, we highlight the TIM barrel as a powerful template for custom enzyme\ndesign and as a model system to explore the intersection of protein\nbiochemistry, biophysics, and design."}
