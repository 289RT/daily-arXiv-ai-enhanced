Abstract: Combinatorial optimization algorithm is essential in computer-aided drug
design by progressively exploring chemical space to design lead compounds with
high affinity to target protein. However current methods face inherent
challenges in integrating domain knowledge, limiting their performance in
identifying lead compounds with novel and valid binding mode. Here, we propose
AutoLeadDesign, a lead compounds design framework that inspires extensive
domain knowledge encoded in large language models with chemical fragments to
progressively implement efficient exploration of vast chemical space. The
comprehensive experiments indicate that AutoLeadDesign outperforms baseline
methods. Significantly, empirical lead design campaigns targeting two
clinically relevant targets (PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) demonstrate
AutoLeadDesign's competence in de novo generation of lead compounds achieving
expert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their
mechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we
find that AutoLeadDesign shares analogous mechanisms with fragment-based drug
design which traditionally rely on the expert decision-making, further
revealing why it works. Overall, AutoLeadDesign offers an efficient approach
for lead compounds design, suggesting its potential utility in drug design.

Conclusion: 验证了基于参数空间的生成建模范式的有效性，并为模型设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in
accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown
impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often
ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space.
However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing
more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to
adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore,
the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is
unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow
model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference
procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design,
demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to
baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based
generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for
model design.

Conclusion: 将蛋白质表示为图像数据为深度学习在生物分子模拟中的应用开辟了新途径，框架还可扩展到其他复杂 3D 结构。

Abstract: Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major
challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved
in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel
pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational
spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into
MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble
learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of
generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative
representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into
2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use
three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new
conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that
interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained
from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that
representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying
advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an
efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed
framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.
