Abstract: The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 in the TCF7L2 gene has been determined as one of the strongest common genetic risk factors for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The location of the SNP in a non-coding region suggests a regulatory mechanism, meaning the SNP doesn't change the protein's own structure but rather affects how the TCF7L2 protein binds to DNA to control other genes. This binding, however, is highly dependent on the shape and flexibility of the DNA. This study aims to reveal the atomic-level effects of the SNP's cytosine-to-thymine substitution on the TCF7L2-DNA complex. We first utilized AlphaFold to generate individual high-confidence structures of the TCF7L2 protein and two 15-base pair DNA duplexes: one containing the reference C allele and one containing the variant T allele. These structures were then used as inputs for Neurosnap's Boltz2 deep learning model to generate two complete protein-DNA complexes of the TCF7L2 HMG-box bound to each DNA variant. Using the iMODS server, we conducted a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) to predict and compare large-scale flexibility and differences in interactions between the complexes. The protein-DNA interface was dissected using PDBsum to locate atomic contacts, clefts, and interaction maps. Overall, our results show that the T allele variant exhibits increased global stiffness with a higher eigenvalue and reduced flexibility, suggesting that the SNP disrupts the mechanism and biomechanical balance needed for efficient TCF7L2-DNA binding, thus affecting downstream gene regulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设蛋白质结合口袋为刚性，忽略了蛋白质的固有灵活性及配体结合引起的构象变化，限制了实际药物发现中的应用。

Method: Apo2Mol利用扩散模型，从无配体的apo状态同时生成3D配体分子及其对应的holo口袋构象，数据集包含24,000多个实验解析的apo-holo结构对。

Result: Apo2Mol在生成高亲和力配体和准确模拟蛋白构象变化方面表现出色，达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: Apo2Mol为解决蛋白质灵活性在药物设计中的挑战提供了有效方案，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Deep generative models are rapidly advancing structure-based drug design, offering substantial promise for generating small molecule ligands that bind to specific protein targets. However, most current approaches assume a rigid protein binding pocket, neglecting the intrinsic flexibility of proteins and the conformational rearrangements induced by ligand binding, limiting their applicability in practical drug discovery. Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states. Empirical studies demonstrate that Apo2Mol can achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity ligands and accurately capture realistic protein pocket conformational changes.

TL;DR: ApexGen是一个基于AI的框架，能够同时设计多肽的氨基酸序列和三维结构，以适应给定的蛋白质靶标。它通过统一的序列和结构设计方法，显著提高了效率和速度，有望加速新型多肽药物的发现。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多肽药物能够结合小分子药物无法触及的蛋白质相互作用位点，且比大蛋白药物更容易生产。然而，设计有效的多肽结合剂具有挑战性，因为可能的序列和结构组合极其庞大。

Method: ApexGen通过在每一步Euler积分中统一序列和结构设计，使用流匹配采样器，能够快速生成全原子肽模型。

Result: 在数百个蛋白质靶标测试中，ApexGen设计的多肽紧密结合靶标表面，覆盖几乎整个结合位点，形状类似于天然蛋白-多肽复合物，并显示出强预测结合亲和力。

Conclusion: ApexGen的高效设计和统一方法为新型多肽疗法的发现提供了快速且有效的途径。

Abstract: Peptide-based drugs can bind to protein interaction sites that small molecules often cannot, and are easier to produce than large protein drugs. However, designing effective peptide binders is difficult. A typical peptide has an enormous number of possible sequences, and only a few of these will fold into the right 3D shape to match a given protein target. Existing computational methods either generate many candidate sequences without considering how they will fold, or build peptide backbones and then find suitable sequences afterward. Here we introduce ApexGen, a new AI-based framework that simultaneously designs a peptide's amino-acid sequence and its three-dimensional structure to fit a given protein target. For each target, ApexGen produces a full all-atom peptide model in a small number of deterministic integration steps. In tests on hundreds of protein targets, the peptides designed by ApexGen fit tightly onto their target surfaces and cover nearly the entire binding site. These peptides have shapes similar to those found in natural protein-peptide complexes, and they show strong predicted binding affinity in computational experiments. Because ApexGen couples sequence and structure design at every step of Euler integration within a flow-matching sampler, it is much faster and more efficient than prior approaches. This unified method could greatly accelerate the discovery of new peptide-based therapeutics.

Motivation: 探索AF3在基础结构预测之外的潜在应用，尤其是抗体-抗原复合物预测及药物开发中的辅助筛选。

Method: 聚焦抗体-抗原（CD47）复合物结构预测，并对比AF3与商用分子对接模块的结合亲和力分析能力。

Result: AF3能高效生成可靠结构及结合能预测，但发现‘反向对接’现象，可能与AI模型架构有关。

Conclusion: AF3在结构预测和药物开发中潜力巨大，但其AI架构可能存在需优化的新问题。

Abstract: AlphaFold 3 (AF3) is a powerful biomolecular structure-predicting tool based on the latest deep learning algorithms and revolutionized AI model architectures. A few of papers have already investigated its accuracy in predicting different biomolecular structures. However, the potential applications of AF3 beyond basic structure prediction have not been fully explored. In our study, we firstly focused on structure predictions of antibody-antigen (CD47) complexes, which is believed to be challenge for AF3 due to limited resolved cognate crystallographic structures. Furtherly, we aimed to the potentiality of AF3 in performing pre-screening for potent antibody candidates as an auxiliary work through binding affinity analysis compared to other molecular docking modules of commercial software, which would greatly benefit the lead identification or optimization process in the drug development. In essence, this is not limited to antibody-antigen binding affinity, but many other chemical or physical properties of any drug candidate based on AF3's accurate predicting structures that are extremely close to the reality. According to our experimental results, AF3 is a very promising competitor, which can efficiently produce highly reliable molecular structures and subsequent binding energy predictions for most subjects. Surprisingly, an unexpected and nonrandom phenomenon "reverse docking" was observed for two of our antibody subjects, suggesting new issues arising from the architectural revolution of AF3. Our analysis and error correction experiments show that this phenomenon is likely to be caused by revolutionized AI model architectures, which provides important experience and reminders for the optimization and design direction of AI for structural prediction.
