  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肽设计方法仅适用于标准氨基酸，NSAAs的设计尚属空白，而NSAAs能显著提升肽药物的结合亲和力和药理学性质。

Method: 提出NS-Pep框架，包含Residue Frequency-Guided Modification（RFGM）和Progressive Side-chain Perception（PSP）等方法，优化NSAAs的设计与建模。

Result: NS-Pep将序列恢复率和结合亲和力分别提升6.23%和5.12%，并在肽折叠任务中超越AlphaFold3 17.76%。

Conclusion: NS-Pep填补了NSAAs肽设计的空白，显著提升了性能，证明了其在药物设计中的潜力。

Abstract: Peptide drugs incorporating non-standard amino acids (NSAAs) offer improved
binding affinity and improved pharmacological properties. However, existing
peptide design methods are limited to standard amino acids, leaving NSAA-aware
design largely unexplored. We introduce NS-Pep, a unified framework for
co-designing peptide sequences and structures with NSAAs. The main challenge is
that NSAAs are extremely underrepresented-even the most frequent one, SEP,
accounts for less than 0.4% of residues-resulting in a severe long-tailed
distribution. To improve generalization to rare amino acids, we propose Residue
Frequency-Guided Modification (RFGM), which mitigates over-penalization through
frequency-aware logit calibration, supported by both theoretical and empirical
analysis. Furthermore, we identify that insufficient side-chain modeling limits
geometric representation of NSAAs. To address this, we introduce Progressive
Side-chain Perception (PSP) for coarse-to-fine torsion and location prediction,
and Interaction-Aware Weighting (IAW) to emphasize pocket-proximal residues.
Moreover, NS-Pep generalizes naturally to the peptide folding task with NSAAs,
addressing a major limitation of current tools. Experiments show that NS-Pep
improves sequence recovery rate and binding affinity by 6.23% and 5.12%,
respectively, and outperforms AlphaFold3 by 17.76% in peptide folding success
rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球IBD发病率上升且缺乏有效治疗药物，需揭示发病机制并开发新药。

Method: 分析UC患者和miR-103a缺陷小鼠的炎症反应，研究c-FOS/miR-103a/NF-kappaB通路机制，并测试CO和loganin的治疗效果。

Result: miR-103a下调导致炎症和屏障破坏；loganin通过上调miR-103a缓解症状。

Conclusion: loganin通过EGFR/c-FOS/miR-103a通路抑制NF-kappaB激活，为UC治疗提供新靶点。

Abstract: Due to the ever-rising global incidence rate of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) and the lack of effective clinical treatment drugs, elucidating the
detailed pathogenesis, seeking novel targets, and developing promising drugs
are the top priority for IBD treatment. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of
microRNA (miR)-103a were significantly downregulated in the inflamed mucosa of
ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, along with elevated inflammatory cytokines
(IL-1beta/TNF-alpha) and reduced tight junction protein (Occludin/ZO-1) levels,
as compared with healthy control objects. Consistently, miR-103a deficient
intestinal epithelial cells Caco-2 showed serious inflammatory responses and
increased permeability, and DSS induced more severe colitis in miR-103a-/- mice
than wild-type ones. Mechanistic studies unraveled that c-FOS suppressed
miR-103a transcription via binding to its promoter, then miR-103a-targeted
NF-kappaB activation contributes to inflammatory responses and barrier
disruption by targeting TAB2 and TAK1. Notably, the traditional Chinese
medicine Cornus officinalis (CO) and its core active ingredient loganin
potently mitigated inflammation and barrier disruption in UC by specifically
blocking the EGFR/RAS/ERK/c-FOS signaling axis, these effects mainly attributed
to modulated miR-103a levels as the therapeutic activities of them were almost
completely shielded in miR-103a KO mice. Taken together, this work reveals that
loganin relieves EGFR/c-FOS axis-suppressed epithelial miR-103a expression,
thereby inhibiting NF-kappaB pathway activation, suppressing inflammatory
responses, and preserving tight junction integrity in UC. Thus, our data enrich
mechanistic insights and promising targets for UC treatment.

### [3] [Twist dominates bending in the liquid crystal organization of bacteriophage DNA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04408)

Main category: cond-mat.soft

TL;DR: DNA在细胞和病毒中常呈现液晶态，Oseen-Frank框架通过三个弹性模量描述这些相。研究通过实验和模拟量化了DNA在噬菌体P4中的弹性模量关系，发现扭转弹性占主导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨DNA在受限环境（如噬菌体P4）中的弹性模量关系，尤其是扭转和弯曲弹性的相对重要性。

Method: 结合冷冻电镜、液晶建模和纽结理论，实验测量DNA层半径，并通过Oseen-Frank模型估算弹性比，再通过Langevin动力学模拟验证。

Result: 测得弹性比α≈0.0064，表明扭转弹性远远超过弯曲弹性，且模拟的纽结分布与实验数据一致。

Conclusion: 研究证实了DNA在噬菌体P4中的弹性模量关系，扭转弹性显著主导，结果为理解DNA液晶态的组织提供了新视角。

Abstract: DNA frequently adopts liquid-crystalline conformations in both cells and
viruses. The Oseen--Frank framework provides a powerful continuum description
of these phases through three elastic moduli: splay ($K_1$), twist or
cholesteric ($K_2$), and bending ($K_3$). While $K_1$ is typically assumed to
dominate, the relative magnitude of $K_2$ and $K_3$ in confined DNA remains
poorly understood. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy, liquid-crystal
modeling, and knot theory to quantify this relationship in bacteriophage P4,
whose genome is partially organized in a spool-like liquid-crystalline phase.
We first show experimentally that the ordered DNA occupies three concentric
layers within the capsid. We then formulate an Oseen--Frank model for this
geometry and use it, together with the measured layer radii, to estimate the
elastic ratio $\alpha = K_3/K_2$. We find $\alpha \approx 0.0064$, indicating
that twist elasticity overwhelmingly dominates bending. To validate this
result, we perform Langevin dynamics simulations of DNA trajectories and
classify the resulting knots. The predicted knot distribution agrees with
experimental data from P4, demonstrating consistency between elasticity,
topology, and observed genome organization.

### [4] [Thin Bridges for Drug Text Alignment: Lightweight Contrastive Learning for Target Specific Drug Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03309)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究探索了通过轻量级对比桥（thin contrastive bridges）对齐化学和文本表示，避免了大型多模态模型的训练需求，并在药物发现中表现出良好的效果。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态基础模型在药物发现和生物医学应用中潜力巨大，但现有方法通常依赖大量预训练或多模态数据。本文旨在通过轻量化方法实现跨模态对齐。

Method: 使用冻结的单模态编码器和轻量级投影头，通过对比目标对齐ECFP4分子指纹和生物医学句子嵌入。引入硬负样本加权和边缘损失以提高效果。

Result: 在基于支架的分割评估中，该方法实现了非平凡的跨模态对齐，并显著提升了目标内辨别能力，优于冻结基线模型。

Conclusion: 轻量级对比桥是一种计算高效的替代方案，支持支架感知的药物文本对齐和目标特异性检索，适用于精准医学。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models hold promise for drug discovery and biomedical
applications, but most existing approaches rely on heavy pretraining or large
scale multimodal corpora. We investigate whether thin contrastive bridges,
lightweight projection heads over frozen unimodal encoders can align chemical
and textual representations without training a full multimodal model. Using
paired mechanisms from ChEMBL, we align ECFP4 molecular fingerprints with
biomedical sentence embeddings through dual linear projections trained with a
contrastive objective. To better handle drugs sharing the same therapeutic
target, we incorporate hard negative weighting and a margin loss. Evaluation
under scaffold based splits, which require generalization across disjoint
chemical cores, demonstrates that our approach achieves non-trivial cross modal
alignment and substantially improves within target discrimination compared to
frozen baselines. These results suggest that thin bridges offer a compute
efficient alternative to large scale multimodal pretraining, enabling scaffold
aware drug text alignment and target specific retrieval in precision medicine.

### [5] [Impact of Force Field Polarization on Correlated Motions of Proteins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04897)
*Ana Milinski,Annick Dejaegere,Roland Stote*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究分析了两种分子动力学模拟的力场（非极化的CHARMM 36m和极化的Drude-2019）对蛋白质相关运动的影响，发现极化力场导致更大的残基波动和更弱的相关运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质的相关运动对生理机制至关重要，但不同力场对其影响尚未量化，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过经典分子动力学模拟分析两种蛋白质（泛素和PPAR___核受体）的残基波动、相关性、社区网络和疏水簇。

Result: Drude-2019力场比非极化力场导致更大的RMS波动和更弱的运动相关性，且疏水簇的天然接触损失更多。

Conclusion: 极化力场对蛋白质相关运动有明显影响，研究首次量化了其在计算研究中的作用。

Abstract: Correlated motions of proteins underpin many physiological mechanisms, such
as substrate binding, signal transduction, enzymatic activity and allostery.
These motions arise from low frequency collective movements of biomolecules and
have mostly been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we present
the effects of two different empirical energy force fields used for molecular
dynamics simulations on correlated motions -- the non-polarizable CHARMM 36m
additive force field and the polarizable Drude-2019 force field. The study was
conducted on two proteins, ubiquitin - a small protein with a well-described
dynamic - and the nuclear receptor protein PPAR___. The ligand binding domain
of PPAR___ was of particular interest since its function is to regulate
transcription through ligand and coregulator protein binding. It has been
previously shown that a dynamical network of correlated motions ensures the
transmission of information related to PPAR___ ligand binding. We present the
results of classical MD simulations where we analyze the results in terms of
residue fluctuations, residue correlation maps, community network analysis and
hydrophobic cluster analysis. We find that RMS fluctuations tend to be greater
and correlated motions are less intense with Drude-2019 force field than with
the non-polarizable all atom additive force field. Analysis of large
hydrophobic clusters in the respective proteins show a greater loss of native
contacts in the simulations using the Drude-2019 force field than in the
simulations using the all atom force additive force field. Our results provide
the first quantification of the impact of using a polarizable force field in
computational studies that focus on correlated motions.
