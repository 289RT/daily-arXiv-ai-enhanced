Conclusion: DynaProt为蛋白质动力学预测提供了可扩展的替代方案，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Many methods have been developed to predict static protein structures,
however understanding the dynamics of protein structure is essential for
elucidating biological function. While molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
remain the in silico gold standard, its high computational cost limits
scalability. We present DynaProt, a lightweight, SE(3)-invariant framework that
predicts rich descriptors of protein dynamics directly from static structures.
By casting the problem through the lens of multivariate Gaussians, DynaProt
estimates dynamics at two complementary scales: (1) per-residue marginal
anisotropy as $3 \times 3$ covariance matrices capturing local flexibility, and
(2) joint scalar covariances encoding pairwise dynamic coupling across
residues. From these dynamics outputs, DynaProt achieves high accuracy in
predicting residue-level flexibility (RMSF) and, remarkably, enables reasonable
reconstruction of the full covariance matrix for fast ensemble generation.
Notably, it does so using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than prior
methods. Our results highlight the potential of direct protein dynamics
prediction as a scalable alternative to existing methods.

Result: 在多种分子系统中验证，OTMol能稳定实现低RMSD值，保持计算效率，并保护分子完整性。

Conclusion: OTMol为分子对齐提供了一种普适性框架，适用于化学信息学和分子建模等领域。

Abstract: Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is widely used to assess structural
similarity in systems ranging from flexible ligand conformers to complex
molecular cluster configurations. Despite its wide utility, RMSD calculation is
often challenged by inconsistent atom ordering, indistinguishable
configurations in molecular clusters, and potential chirality inversion during
alignment. These issues highlight the necessity of accurate atom-to-atom
correspondence as a prerequisite for meaningful alignment. Traditional
approaches often rely on heuristic cost matrices combined with the Hungarian
algorithm, yet these methods underutilize the rich intra-molecular structural
information and may fail to generalize across chemically diverse systems. In
this work, we introduce OTMol, a method that formulates the molecular alignment
task as a fused supervised Gromov-Wasserstein (fsGW) optimal transport problem.
By leveraging the intrinsic geometric and topological relationships within each
molecule, OTMol eliminates the need for manually defined cost functions and
enables a principled, data-driven matching strategy. Importantly, OTMol
preserves key chemical features such as molecular chirality and bond
connectivity consistency. We evaluate OTMol across a wide range of molecular
systems, including Adenosine triphosphate, Imatinib, lipids, small peptides,
and water clusters, and demonstrate that it consistently achieves low RMSD
values while preserving computational efficiency. Importantly, OTMol maintains
molecular integrity by enforcing one-to-one mappings between entire molecules,
thereby avoiding erroneous many-to-one alignments that often arise in comparing
molecular clusters. Our results underscore the utility of optimal transport
theory for molecular alignment and offer a generalizable framework applicable
to structural comparison tasks in cheminformatics, molecular modeling, and
related disciplines.

### [3] [Morphology-Specific Peptide Discovery via Masked Conditional Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02060)
*Nuno Costa,Julija Zavadlav*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: PepMorph是一种端到端肽发现流程，能够生成自组装为特定形态的新肽序列，准确率达83%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肽自组装预测可用于设计生物相容性材料，但现有方法难以筛选大量序列。

Method: 结合几何和物理化学描述符数据集，训练基于Transformer的条件变分自编码器，生成新肽序列。

Result: PepMorph在目标形态生成中达到83%的准确率。

Conclusion: PepMorph为应用驱动的肽发现提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Peptide self-assembly prediction offers a powerful bottom-up strategy for
designing biocompatible, low-toxicity materials for large-scale synthesis in a
broad range of biomedical and energy applications. However, screening the vast
sequence space for categorization of aggregate morphology remains intractable.
We introduce PepMorph, an end-to-end peptide discovery pipeline that generates
novel sequences that are not only prone to aggregate but self-assemble into a
specified fibrillar or spherical morphology. We compiled a new dataset by
leveraging existing aggregation propensity datasets and extracting geometric
and physicochemical isolated peptide descriptors that act as proxies for
aggregate morphology. This dataset is then used to train a Transformer-based
Conditional Variational Autoencoder with a masking mechanism, which generates
novel peptides under arbitrary conditioning. After filtering to ensure design
specifications and validation of generated sequences through coarse-grained
molecular dynamics simulations, PepMorph yielded 83% accuracy in intended
morphology generation, showcasing its promise as a framework for
application-driven peptide discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物分子的长时间尺度动态模拟是计算科学的难题，传统依赖预定义集体变量的方法难以实现。

Conclusion: 研究为原子级蛋白动态模拟提供了实用的传播方法选择指南。

Abstract: Simulating the long-timescale dynamics of biomolecules is a central challenge
in computational science. While enhanced sampling methods can accelerate these
simulations, they rely on pre-defined collective variables that are often
difficult to identify. A recent generative model, LD-FPG, demonstrated that
this problem could be bypassed by learning to sample the static equilibrium
ensemble as all-atom deformations from a reference structure, establishing a
powerful method for all-atom ensemble generation. However, while this approach
successfully captures a system's probable conformations, it does not model the
temporal evolution between them. Here we extend LD-FPG with a temporal
propagator that operates within the learned latent space and compare three
classes: (i) score-guided Langevin dynamics, (ii) Koopman-based linear
operators, and (iii) autoregressive neural networks. Within a unified
encoder-propagator-decoder framework, we evaluate long-horizon stability,
backbone and side-chain ensemble fidelity, and functional free-energy
landscapes. Autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long
rollouts; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when
the score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight
baseline that tends to damp fluctuations. These results clarify the trade-offs
among propagators and offer practical guidance for latent-space simulators of
all-atom protein dynamics.
