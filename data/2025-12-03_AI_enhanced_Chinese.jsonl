Here, we present a dry-to-wet framework combining generative modeling and experimental validation to optimize peptides targeting ATP5A, a potential peptide-binding protein for GBM. Our framework introduces the first lead-conditioned generative model, which focuses exploration on geometrically relevant regions around lead peptides and mitigates the combinatorial complexity of de novo methods. Specifically, we propose POTFlow, a \\underline{P}rior and \\underline{O}ptimal \\underline{T}ransport-based \\underline{Flow}-matching model for peptide optimization. POTFlow employs secondary structure information (e.g., helix, sheet, loop) as geometric constraints, which are further refined by optimal transport to produce shorter flow paths. With this design, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with five popular approaches. When applied to GBM, our method generates peptides that selectively inhibit cell viability and significantly prolong survival in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model.

This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \\emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \\emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \\textit{de-novo} hits.

One possible explanation provides the RNA world hypothesis. It states that life could emerge from RNA strands only, storing and transferring biological information, as well as catalyzing reactions as ribozymes. Before this state could have emerged, however, the prebiotic world was probably a purely chemical pool of short RNA strands with random sequences and without biological function performing hybridization and dehybridization, as well as ligation and cleavage. In this context relevant questions are what are the conditions that allow longer RNA strands to be built and how can information carrying in RNA sequence emerge?\n  In order to investigate such RNA reactors, efficient simulations are needed because the space of possible RNA sequences increases exponentially with the length of the strands, as well as the number of reactions between two strands. In addition, simulations have to be compared to experimental data for validation and parameter calibration. Here, we present the MoRSAIK python package for sequence motif (or k-mer) reactor simulation, analysis and inference. It enables users to simulate RNA sequence motif dynamics in the mean field approximation as well as to infer the reaction parameters from data with Bayesian methods and to analyze results by computing observables and plotting. MoRSAIK simulates an RNA reactor by following the reactions and the concentrations of all strands inside up to a certain length (of four nucleotides by default).

We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\\leq$2\\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65e0\u5173\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5206\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u5c06\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u81f3\u603b\u635f\u5931\u76842%\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65e0\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65f6\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u635f\u5931\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5206\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u3001\u529b\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u964d\u566a\uff09\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u57281k-10k\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u5185\u5c06\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u5feb\u901f\u964d\u4f4e\u81f32%\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u7f29\u5c0f\u7b49\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e603D\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u662f\u6bd4\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u3002\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u5176\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u635f\u5931\u60e9\u7f5a\u800c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

Here we investigate the rheology of the transcription factor NANOG, a key protein in sustaining embryonic stem cell self-renewal. We discover that at high concentrations NANOG forms macroscopic aging gels through its intrinsically disordered tryptophan-rich domain. By combining molecular dynamics simulations, mass photometry and Cryo-EM, we also discover that NANOG forms self-limiting micelle-like clusters which expose their DNA-binding domains. In dense solutions of DNA, NANOG micelle-like structures stabilize intermolecular entanglements and crosslinks, forming microgel-like structures.
