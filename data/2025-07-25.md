Abstract: Porous nanomaterials have recently attracted a lot of attention due to
various properties and potential applications. In this study, carbon
nanoparticles (CNPs) were synthesized by the one-pot hydrothermal carbonization
(HTC) using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Urea was used as the nitrogen source
for carbonization. The presence of urea in CMC solution for carbonization
resulted in CNPsu reduction in the diameter of particles from 4 micrometer to 1
micrometer. Activation process at high temperature for both the above samples
resulted in nanoparticles with diameter of 51 nm and 31 nm, respectively. The
positive effect of presence urea and its activation generated different
functional groups including C-N, N-H, and C -(triple bond)- N with increasing
aromatic rings that probably may help entrapment of drugs into them. On the
other hand, activation CNPsu (ACNPsu) has the most aromatic rings with the
lowest hydroxyl groups with 84.66% carbon and 12.29% oxygen in its structures.
ACNPs, and ACNPsu exhibited a type I isotherm indicating microporous materials
with a high surface area about 552.9 m2/g and 351.01 m2/g, respectively. The
high surface area was characteristic of activated carbons with their high
adsorption capacity. Thus, the synthesized materials were characterized using
SEM, TEM, DLS, BET, FTIR, HNMR, and TGA techniques. Finally, the encapsulation
of clindamycin drug (CD) with positive charge in different types of NPs with
negative charge was investigated for drug delivery in biomedical engineering
applications.

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

Abstract: The origin of life on Earth via the spontaneous emergence of a protocell
prior to Darwinian evolution remains a fundamental open question in physics and
chemistry. Here, we develop a conceptual framework based on information theory
and algorithmic complexity. Using estimates grounded in modern computational
models, we evaluate the difficulty of assembling structured biological
information under plausible prebiotic conditions. Our results highlight the
formidable entropic and informational barriers to forming a viable protocell
within the available window of Earth's early history. While the idea of Earth
being terraformed by advanced extraterrestrials might violate Occam's razor
from within mainstream science, directed panspermia -- originally proposed by
Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel -- remains a speculative but logically open
alternative. Ultimately, uncovering physical principles for life's spontaneous
emergence remains a grand challenge for biological physics.
