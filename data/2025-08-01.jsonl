Firstly, it aims at elucidating the role of\nepistasis in shaping, at a molecular level, the evolutionary paths of proteins,\nas well as the extent to which these epistatic effects are the outcome of an\nas-yet-unidentified epistatic force. Second, it seeks to ascertain the extent\nto which the principle of least action will enable us to identify which of all\npotential trajectories has the highest evolutionary efficiency, as well as how\nvariations in factors such as protein robustness and folding rates, resulting\nfrom the unavoidability of destabilizing mutations, might influence this\ncritical evolutionary process. The initial findings suggest that protein\nevolution, at a molecular level, may be more predictable than previously\nthought, as epistasis and the principle of least action collectively impose\nconstraints on evolutionary paths and trajectories, and consequently, on\nprotein evolvability. Thus, this work should advance our understanding of the\nmain molecular mechanisms that underlie the evolution of mutation-driven\nproteins and also provide grounds to answer a fundamental evolutionary\nquestion: how does Darwinian selection regard all potential trajectories\navailable?"}
