Abstract: Aberrant protein-protein interactions (PPIs) underpin a plethora of human
diseases, and disruption of these harmful interactions constitute a compelling
treatment avenue. Advances in computational approaches to PPI prediction have
closely followed progress in deep learning and natural language processing. In
this review, we outline the state-of the-art for sequence-based PPI prediction
methods and explore their impact on target identification and drug discovery.
We begin with an overview of commonly used training data sources and techniques
used to curate these data to enhance the quality of the training set.
Subsequently, we survey various PPI predictor types, including traditional
similarity-based approaches, and deep learning-based approaches with a
particular emphasis on the transformer architecture. Finally, we provide
examples of PPI prediction in systems-level proteomics analyses, target
identification, and design of therapeutic peptides and antibodies. We also take
the opportunity to showcase the potential of PPI-aware drug discovery models in
accelerating therapeutic development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在蛋白质口袋中高效生成配体结合构象的问题，为大规模虚拟筛选提供可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 将结合位点离散化为网格，通过QUBO问题选择空间分布且能量有利的网格点，配体通过刚性变换与网格点对齐生成候选构象。

Result: 在169个蛋白质-配体复合物基准测试中，生成大量候选构象，通过评分筛选后，恢复率在高精度下可达100%，总体表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架模块化且硬件灵活，适合作为亲和力预测前的预过滤工具，适用于大规模虚拟筛选。

Abstract: We propose a framework based on Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) for generating plausible ligand binding poses within protein pockets,
enabling efficient structure-based virtual screening. The method discretizes
the binding site into a grid and solves a QUBO problem to select spatially
distributed, energetically favorable grid points. Each ligand is represented by
a three-atom geometric contour, which is aligned to the selected grid points
through rigid-body transformation, producing from hundreds to hundreds of
thousands of candidate poses. Using a benchmark of 169 protein-ligand
complexes, we generated an average of 110 to 600000 poses per ligand, depending
on QUBO parameters and matching thresholds. Evaluation against crystallographic
structures revealed that a larger number of candidates increases the likelihood
of recovering near-native poses, with recovery rates reaching 100 percent for
root mean square deviation (RMSD) values below 1.0 angstrom and 95.9 percent
for RMSD values below 0.6 angstrom. Since the correct binding pose is not known
in advance, we apply AutoDock-based scoring to select the most plausible
candidates from the generated pool, achieving recovery rates of up to 82.8
percent for RMSD < 2.0 angstrom, 81.7 percent for RMSD < 1.5 angstrom, and 75.2
percent for RMSD < 1.0 angstrom. When poses with misleading scores are
excluded, performance improves further, with recovery rates reaching up to 97.8
percent for RMSD < 2.0 angstrom and 1.5 angstrom, and 95.4 percent for RMSD <
1.0 angstrom. This modular and hardware-flexible framework offers a scalable
solution for pre-filtering ligands and generating high-quality binding poses
before affinity prediction, making it well-suited for large-scale virtual
screening pipelines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个用于酶热稳定性建模的新数据集和深度学习框架Segment Transformer，通过分段表示实现了高效准确的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验测定酶的热参数成本高且耗时，现有计算方法受限于数据不足和不平衡分布，因此需要新的解决方案。

Method: 基于新数据集，开发了Segment Transformer框架，利用分段表示预测酶的热稳定性。

Result: 模型在多项指标上达到先进水平，并通过实验验证成功指导了一种酶的改造，提高了其热稳定性。

Conclusion: Segment Transformer结合分段表示有效解决了酶热稳定性预测问题，并具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Developing enzymes with desired thermal properties is crucial for a wide
range of industrial and research applications, and determining temperature
stability is an essential step in this process. Experimental determination of
thermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover,
existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data
availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model
development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this
dataset, we present the \textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning
framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature
stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of
24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating
segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that
different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal
behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide
the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a
1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved
through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.

TL;DR: MEVO是一个进化框架，通过桥接小分子数据集和稀缺的蛋白-配体复合物数据集，解决了结构药物设计（SBDD）中的数据限制问题。它包含三个关键组件：高保真VQ-VAE、扩散模型和口袋感知进化策略，能够高效生成高亲和力结合物，并在KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$等挑战性目标上展示了其能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成模型在结构药物设计（SBDD）中的应用受限，主要因为训练数据稀缺。研究旨在通过MEVO框架解决这一问题，提升数据效率。

Method: MEVO结合了高保真VQ-VAE、扩散模型和口袋感知进化策略，利用物理评分函数优化分子设计。

Result: MEVO成功生成了多种蛋白目标的高亲和力结合物，并在KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$抑制剂设计上表现出色。

Conclusion: MEVO是一个高效且数据利用率高的框架，适用于多种结构配体设计任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, particularly diffusion and
auto-regressive models, have revolutionized fields like computer vision and
natural language processing. However, their application to structure-based drug
design (SBDD) remains limited due to critical data constraints. To address the
limitation of training data for models targeting SBDD tasks, we propose an
evolutionary framework named MEVO, which bridges the gap between billion-scale
small molecule dataset and the scarce protein-ligand complex dataset, and
effectively increase the abundance of training data for generative SBDD models.
MEVO is composed of three key components: a high-fidelity VQ-VAE for molecule
representation in latent space, a diffusion model for pharmacophore-guided
molecule generation, and a pocket-aware evolutionary strategy for molecule
optimization with physics-based scoring function. This framework efficiently
generate high-affinity binders for various protein targets, validated with
predicted binding affinities using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. In
addition, we showcase the capability of MEVO in designing potent inhibitors to
KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$, a challenging target in cancer therapeutics, with
similar affinity to the known highly active inhibitor evaluated by FEP
calculations. With high versatility and generalizability, MEVO offers an
effective and data-efficient model for various tasks in structure-based ligand
design.

Abstract: DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) are integral to gene regulation and cellular
processes, making their accurate identification essential for understanding
biological functions and disease mechanisms. Experimental methods for DBP
identification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient
computational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder
with a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly
from raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions
within residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich
sequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture
hierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We
conducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings
from ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that
ProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large
datasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller
datasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive
evaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It
achieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On
independent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2%
and 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as
PDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and
specificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced
deep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse
genomic contexts.
