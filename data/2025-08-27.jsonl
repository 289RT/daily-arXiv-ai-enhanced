These innovations dramatically improve\npredictive accuracy and generalization across diverse protein families,\nsurpassing previous methods. Crucially, AlphaFold 3 embodies a paradigm shift\ntoward differentiable simulation, bridging traditional static structural\nmodeling with dynamic molecular simulations.

Nevertheless,\nIDRs play critical roles in the most tightly regulated cellular processes,\nincluding in the core circadian clock. The molecular oscillator at the heart of\ncircadian regulation leverages IDRs as dynamic interaction modules for\nactivation and repression to support robust timekeeping and expand clock output\nand regulation. Here, we cover the biophysical mechanisms conferred by IDRs and\ntheir modulators. We survey the intrinsically disordered regions in clock\nproteins that are widely prevalent from fungi to mammals and discuss the\nimportance of IDRs to the core clock and beyond."}

The urgent need for\nnew treatment alternatives has brought attention to the potential of plants,\nwhich harbor a wealth of unexplored phytochemicals with therapeutic properties.\nThis study aims to evaluate the anti-bacterial efficacy of methanol and aqueous\nextracts from the leaves and bark of Horsfieldia iryaghedhi In vitro.\nMethodology: Aqueous and methanol extracts were obtained from the cold\nmaceration method. In vitro anti-bacterial activity of methanol and aqueous\nleaf, bark, and combination extracts were determined against gram-negative\nbacteria Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and gram-positive bacteria\nStaphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923). The anti-bacterial assay for different\nconcentrations of each extract was conducted through the well-diffusion method,\nwith Gentamycin serving as the positive control. Results: Methanol leaf and\ncombination extracts of Horsfieldia iryaghedhi have shown a positive\nanti-bacterial response at their highest concentrations of 1000mcg/mL and\n500mcg/mL against grampositive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus while none of the\nextracts showed anti-bacterial activity against gram-negative E. coli at the\nexperimented concentrations. Conclusion: The study concludes that methanol\nextracts of H.iryaghedhi should be further analyzed for their anti-bacterial\nactivity, and there could be potential lead molecules that can be developed as\nantibiotics"}

Gentamicin 10 {\\mu}g/\ndisk and distilled water was used as positive and negative controls\nrespectively The study revealed, for the first time, that the extract possessed\nsignificant antibacterial activity against all four test organisms in a\nconcentration dependent manner (r values ranging from 0.921-0.992, P<0.01) with\ninhibition zone diameters ranging between 8 and 28 mm. Highest antibacterial\nactivity was exhibited against B. subtilis at 1000 {\\mu}g/ disk (27.43-+0.02\nmm). The extract showed inhibitory effects comparable to gentamicin towards B.\nsubtilis and P. aeruginosa at 500 {\\mu}g/ disk and towards E. coli and S.\naureus at 1000 {\\mu}g/ disk. Qualitative phytochemical screening revealed the\npresence of flavonoids, tannins, phenols, cardiac glycosides, amino acids,\ncarbohydrates, alkaloids and saponins. Therefore it is likely that the\nantibacterial effect of the extract is mediated by synergistic mechanisms.\nFurthermore, results of this study scientifically justified the claim\ntraditional and folk medicine in the treatment of abscesses, wounds and ulcers\nand indicated the potential for the development of a novel drug from mature\nleaves of Asystasia variabilis."}
