However,\nprior approaches for exploring the alternative branching structures were\ncomputationally inefficient for long sequences.\n  Results: We present a novel algorithm that partitions the parameter space,\nidentifying all distinct branching structures (optimal under different\nbranching parameters) for a given RNA sequence using the fewest possible\nminimum free energy computations. Our method efficiently computes the full\nparameter-space partition and the associated optimal structures, enabling a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the structural landscape across parameter choices.\nWe apply this algorithm to the Archive II benchmarking dataset, assessing the\nmaximum attainable prediction accuracy for each sequence under the\nreparameterized multiloop model. We find that the potential for improvement\nover default predictions is substantial in many cases, and that the optimal\nprediction accuracy is highly sensitive to auxiliary modeling decisions, such\nas the treatment of lonely base pairs and dangling ends.\n  Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that the conventional choice\nof multiloop parameters may limit prediction accuracy and that exploring\nalternative parameterizations is both tractable and worthwhile. The efficient\npartitioning algorithm we introduce makes this exploration feasible for longer\nsequences and larger datasets. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges\nin identifying the optimal structure."}
