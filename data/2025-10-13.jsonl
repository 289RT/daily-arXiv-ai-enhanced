We address this limitation by enforcing physical\nvalidity as a strict constraint during both training and inference with a\nuniffed module. At its core is a differentiable projection that maps the\nprovisional atom coordinates from the diffusion model to the nearest physically\nvalid conffguration. This projection is achieved using a Gauss-Seidel scheme,\nwhich exploits the locality and sparsity of the constraints to ensure stable\nand fast convergence at scale. By implicit differentiation to obtain gradients,\nour module integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks for end-to-end\nffnetuning. With our Gauss-Seidel projection module in place, two denoising\nsteps are sufffcient to produce biomolecular complexes that are both physically\nvalid and structurally accurate. Across six benchmarks, our 2-step model\nachieves the same structural accuracy as state-of-the-art 200-step diffusion\nbaselines, delivering approximately 10 times faster wall-clock speed while\nguaranteeing physical validity."}

This paper presents a communication system design using a\nlight-modulated protein channel: Synthetic Photoisomerizable\nAzobenzene-regulated K+ (SPARK). Our approach involves a comprehensive design\nincorporating the SPARK-based receiver, encoding methods, modulation\ntechniques, and detection processes. By analyzing the resulting communication\nsystem, we determine how different parameters influence its performance.\nFurthermore, we explore the potential design in terms of bioengineering and\ndemonstrate that the data rate scales up with the number of receptors,\nindicating the possibility of achieving high-speed communication."}

Invited review article", "summary": "DNA strand displacement (SD) reactions are central to the operation of many\nsynthetic nucleic acid systems, including molecular circuits, sensors, and\nmachines. Over the years, a broad set of design frameworks has emerged to\naccommodate various functional goals, initial configurations, and environmental\nconditions. Nevertheless, key challenges persist, particularly in reliably\npredicting reaction kinetics. This review examines recent approaches to SD\nreaction design, with emphasis on the properties of single reactions, including\nkinetics, structural factors, and limitations in current modelling practices.\nWe identify promising innovations while analysing the factors that continue to\nhinder predictive accuracy. We conclude by outlining future directions for\nachieving more robust and programmable behaviour in DNA-based systems."}
