We\nintroduce AbRank, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that\nreframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem. AbRank aggregates\nover 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse\nantibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized\ndata splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local\nperturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel\nantigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an\nm-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal\naffinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold\ndifference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we\nintroduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein\nlanguage model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise\nbinding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current\nmethods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that\nranking-based training improves robustness and transferability. In summary,\nAbRank offers a robust foundation for machine learning models to generalize\nacross the antibody-antigen space, with direct relevance for scalable,\nstructure-aware antibody therapeutic design."}

To\naddress this issue, we introduce a two-stage progressive framework, OmniESI,\nfor enzyme-substrate interaction prediction through conditional deep learning.\nBy decomposing the modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions into a two-stage\nprogressive process, OmniESI incorporates two conditional networks that\nrespectively emphasize enzymatic reaction specificity and crucial\ncatalysis-related interactions, facilitating a gradual feature modulation in\nthe latent space from general protein-molecule domain to catalysis-aware\ndomain. On top of this unified architecture, OmniESI can adapt to a variety of\ndownstream tasks, including enzyme kinetic parameter prediction,\nenzyme-substrate pairing prediction, enzyme mutational effect prediction, and\nenzymatic active site annotation. Under the multi-perspective performance\nevaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, OmniESI\nconsistently delivered superior performance than state-of-the-art specialized\nmethods across seven benchmarks. More importantly, the proposed conditional\nnetworks were shown to internalize the fundamental patterns of catalytic\nefficiency while significantly improving prediction performance, with only\nnegligible parameter increases (0.16%), as demonstrated by ablation studies on\nkey components. Overall, OmniESI represents a unified predictive approach for\nenzyme-substrate interactions, providing an effective tool for catalytic\nmechanism cracking and enzyme engineering with strong generalization and broad\napplicability."}
