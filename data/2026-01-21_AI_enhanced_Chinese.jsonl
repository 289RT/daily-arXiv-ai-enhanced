Despite its critical role, reverse screening remains challenging because accurately capturing interactions between a small molecule and structurally diverse proteins is inherently complex, and conventional step-wise workflows often propagate errors across decoupled steps such as target structure modeling, pocket identification, docking, and scoring. Here, we present an end-to-end reverse screening strategy leveraging HelixFold3, a high-accuracy biomolecular structure prediction model akin to AlphaFold3, which simultaneously models the folding of proteins from a protein library and the docking of small-molecule ligands within a unified framework. We validate this approach on a diverse and representative set of approximately one hundred small molecules. Compared with conventional reverse docking, our method improves screening accuracy and demonstrates enhanced structural fidelity, binding-site precision, and target prioritization. By systematically linking small molecules to their protein targets, this framework establishes a scalable and straightforward platform for dissecting molecular mechanisms, exploring off-target interactions, and supporting rational drug discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eHelixFold3\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53cd\u5411\u7b5b\u9009\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9776\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b5b\u9009\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cd\u5411\u7b5b\u9009\u5728\u836f\u7269\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6b65\u9aa4\u8131\u8282\u4e14\u6613\u4f20\u64ad\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528HelixFold3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u914d\u4f53\u5bf9\u63a5\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u767e\u591a\u79cd\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u5411\u5bf9\u63a5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7b5b\u9009\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9776\u6807\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u6790\u5206\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u548c\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Conventional generate-score-screen approaches become impractical under such realistic design specifications, owing to their low search efficiency, unreliable generalizability of machine-learning prediction, and the prohibitive cost of quantum chemical calculation. Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications. Overall, these results establish LUMOS as a data-physics dual-driven framework for general fluorophore inverse design.", "AI": {"tldr": "LUMOS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8367\u5149\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u9006\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7b5b\u9009\u8367\u5149\u5206\u5b50\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0cLUMOS\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "LUMOS\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u5feb\u901fTD-DFT\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "LUMOS\u5728\u8367\u5149\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8367\u5149\u5206\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "LUMOS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8367\u5149\u5206\u5b50\u9006\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}
