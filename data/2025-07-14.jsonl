Diffusion models (DMs), an\nemerging tool, have recently attracted great attention in drug R\\&D. This paper\ncomprehensively reviews the latest advancements and applications of DMs in\nmolecular generation. It begins by introducing the theoretical principles of\nDMs. Subsequently, it categorizes various DM-based molecular generation methods\naccording to their mathematical and chemical applications. The review further\nexamines the performance of these models on benchmark datasets, with a\nparticular focus on comparing the generation performance of existing 3D\nmethods. Finally, it concludes by emphasizing current challenges and suggesting\nfuture research directions to fully exploit the potential of DMs in drug\ndiscovery."}

The model\ncouples residue-level ProtT5/ESM2 embeddings with sequence-level descriptors in\ndual local and global branches, aligned by a cross-attention module and trained\nwith log-cosh loss for robustness to assay noise. The optimal AmpLyze model\nreaches a PCC of 0.756 and an MSE of 0.987, outperforming classical regressors\nand the state-of-the-art. Ablations confirm that both branches are essential,\nand cross-attention adds a further 1% PCC and 3% MSE improvement.\nExpected-Gradients attributions reveal known toxicity hotspots and suggest\nsafer substitutions. By turning hemolysis assessment into a quantitative,\nsequence-based, and interpretable prediction, AmpLyze facilitates AMP design\nand offers a practical tool for early-stage toxicity screening."}

While data on native 3D\nstructures are abundant, data on 3D structures of non-native intermediates\nremain sparse, due to limitations of current technologies for experimental\ndetermination of 3D structures. Yet, analyzing folding intermediates is crucial\nfor understanding folding dynamics and misfolding-related diseases. Hence, we\nsearch the literature for available (experimentally and computationally\nobtained) 3D structural data on folding intermediates, organizing the data in a\ncentralized resource. Additionally, we assess whether existing methods,\ndesigned for predicting native structures, can also be utilized to predict\nstructures of non-native intermediates.\n  Results: Our literature search reveals six studies that provide 3D structural\ndata on folding intermediates (two for post-translational and four for\nco-translational folding), each focused on a single protein, with 2-4\nintermediates. Our assessment shows that an established method for predicting\nnative structures, AlphaFold2, does not perform well for non-native\nintermediates in the context of co-translational folding; a recent study on\npost-translational folding concluded the same for even more existing methods.\nYet, we identify in the literature recent pioneering methods designed\nexplicitly to predict 3D structures of folding intermediates by incorporating\nintrinsic biophysical characteristics of folding dynamics, which show promise.\nThis study assesses the current landscape and future directions of the field of\n3D structural analysis of protein folding dynamics."}
