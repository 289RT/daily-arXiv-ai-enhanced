  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物设计中，准确预测小分子的3D构象是重要挑战，尤其是当存在模板配体时如何利用其几何信息。

Method: 方法分为两阶段：首先基于流匹配的分子对齐生成初始构象，再通过可微优化进行形状、药效团和能量的细化。

Result: 在新基准测试中，该方法优于标准对接工具和开放对齐方法，尤其在模板相似度低或配体灵活性高时表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模板指导的两阶段策略，显著提升了3D构象预测的准确性。

Abstract: Predicting the 3D conformation of small molecules within protein binding
sites is a key challenge in drug design. When a crystallized reference ligand
(template) is available, it provides geometric priors that can guide 3D pose
prediction. We present a two-stage method for ligand conformation generation
guided by such templates. In the first stage, we introduce a molecular
alignment approach based on flow-matching to generate 3D coordinates for the
ligand, using the template structure as a reference. In the second stage, a
differentiable pose optimization procedure refines this conformation based on
shape and pharmacophore similarities, internal energy, and, optionally, the
protein binding pocket. We evaluate our approach on a new benchmark of ligand
pairs co-crystallized with the same target and show that it outperforms
standard docking tools and open-access alignment methods, especially in cases
involving low similarity to the template or high ligand flexibility.

Motivation: 研究NSUN2和m5C在癌症中的作用机制，为癌症治疗提供新的靶点和方向。

Method: 综述NSUN2和m5C在多种癌症中的促癌机制及其与预后的关系。

Result: NSUN2过表达通过m5C修饰促进癌症发展，与不良预后相关。

Conclusion: NSUN2可作为预后指标和治疗靶点，为癌症治疗提供新思路。

Abstract: m5C modification is a type of RNA methylation modification, and its major
methyltransferase, NSUN2, catalyzes m5C modification. NSUN2 is overexpressed in
a variety of cancers, and it affects the metabolism of RNA from target genes by
affecting the level of m5C modification in cancer cells, which in turn promotes
the development of cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. This review
summarizes the mechanisms by which NSUN2 and m5C play a pro-cancer role in
various cancers, and the relationship between NSUN2 and the prognosis of
various cancers, with the aim of identifying NSUN2 as a prognostic indicator
and a target for future cancer therapy, and to provide a clearer therapeutic
idea and direction for the future treatment of cancer.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs), as topology/structure-aware models within deep
learning, have emerged as powerful tools for AI-aided drug discovery (AIDD). By
directly operating on molecular graphs, GNNs offer an intuitive and expressive
framework for learning the complex topological and geometric features of
drug-like molecules, cementing their role in modern molecular modeling. This
review provides a comprehensive overview of the methodological foundations and
representative applications of GNNs in drug discovery, spanning tasks such as
molecular property prediction, virtual screening, molecular generation,
biomedical knowledge graph construction, and synthesis planning. Particular
attention is given to recent methodological advances, including geometric GNNs,
interpretable models, uncertainty quantification, scalable graph architectures,
and graph generative frameworks. We also discuss how these models integrate
with modern deep learning approaches, such as self-supervised learning,
multi-task learning, meta-learning and pre-training. Throughout this review, we
highlight the practical challenges and methodological bottlenecks encountered
when applying GNNs to real-world drug discovery pipelines, and conclude with a
discussion on future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于蛋白质功能注释类别繁多且分布极不平衡，蛋白质表示学习在功能预测方面面临巨大挑战。

Method: 采用直接偏好优化（DPO）方法，设计偏好对齐的训练目标，结合多模态框架（AnnoDPO）进行蛋白质功能预测。

Result: AnnoDPO为蛋白质表示学习中生物知识整合建立了新的范式。

Conclusion: 通过偏好优化和多模态框架的结合，AnnoDPO有效解决了蛋白质功能预测中的注释稀缺和类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: Deciphering protein function remains a fundamental challenge in protein
representation learning. The task presents significant difficulties for protein
language models (PLMs) due to the sheer volume of functional annotation
categories and the highly imbalanced distribution of annotated instances across
biological ontologies. Inspired by the remarkable success of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) in large language model (LLM) alignment, we
propose AnnoDPO, a novel multi-modal framework for protein function prediction
that leverages Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance annotation
learning. Our methodology addresses the dual challenges of annotation scarcity
and category imbalance through preference-aligned training objectives,
establishing a new paradigm for biological knowledge integration in protein
representation learning.

### [5] [GLProtein: Global-and-Local Structure Aware Protein Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06294)
*Yunqing Liu,Wenqi Fan,Xiaoyong Wei,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLProtein是一种新的蛋白质预训练框架，首次整合了全局结构相似性和局部氨基酸细节，以提高预测精度和功能性见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管通过蛋白质序列分析已经取得了一定进展，但整合蛋白质结构信息仍有潜力可挖。研究者认为蛋白质结构信息不仅限于3D信息，还包括氨基酸分子（局部信息）到蛋白质间结构相似性（全局信息）。

Method: GLProtein创新性地结合了蛋白质掩模建模与三元结构相似性评分、蛋白质3D距离编码和基于子结构的氨基酸分子编码。

Result: 实验结果表明，GLProtein在多个生物信息学任务中（如蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用预测和接触预测等）优于以往的方法。

Conclusion: GLProtein通过结合全局与局部结构信息，显著提升了蛋白质功能预测的准确性。

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks
across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein
functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for
further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue
that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D
information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local
information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To
address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein
pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local
amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights.
GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure
similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino
acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein
outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including
predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.

### [6] [Unlocking Chemical Insights: Superior Molecular Representations from Intermediate Encoder Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06443)
*Luis Pinto*

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅使用分子编码器的最终层嵌入可能丢失有价值信息，研究旨在探索中间层嵌入的潜力以提高预测性能。

Method: 对五种不同分子编码器进行层间分析，覆盖22种ADMET属性预测任务，评估固定嵌入和微调中间层的效果。

Result: 中间层嵌入平均提升5.4%性能（最高28.6%），微调后平均提升8.5%（最高40.8%），并在多个任务中达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 全面利用分子编码器的表征深度可显著提升性能与计算效率，支持“评估后微调”的高效策略。

Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational
chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation.
However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for
downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge
this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five
diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our
results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently
outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings
from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an
average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to
these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%,
with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art
results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation
between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an
efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal
layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance
of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve
substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Protein Transformers是否能捕捉蛋白质序列中的生物智能，并解决其解释性难题。

Conclusion: SPT模型高效且可解释，Protein-FN数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly Transformers, have been widely adopted for
predicting the functional properties of proteins. In this work, we focus on
exploring whether Protein Transformers can capture biological intelligence
among protein sequences. To achieve our goal, we first introduce a protein
function dataset, namely Protein-FN, providing over 9000 protein data with
meaningful labels. Second, we devise a new Transformer architecture, namely
Sequence Protein Transformers (SPT), for computationally efficient protein
function predictions. Third, we develop a novel Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) technique called Sequence Score, which can efficiently
interpret the decision-making processes of protein models, thereby overcoming
the difficulty of deciphering biological intelligence bided in Protein
Transformers. Remarkably, even our smallest SPT-Tiny model, which contains only
5.4M parameters, demonstrates impressive predictive accuracy, achieving 94.3%
on the Antibiotic Resistance (AR) dataset and 99.6% on the Protein-FN dataset,
all accomplished by training from scratch. Besides, our Sequence Score
technique helps reveal that our SPT models can discover several meaningful
patterns underlying the sequence structures of protein data, with these
patterns aligning closely with the domain knowledge in the biology community.
We have officially released our Protein-FN dataset on Hugging Face Datasets
