For the vast majority, we do not know what the\nfunctional consequences - if any - will be. Further, mechanistic insight, such\nas structural details, would be immensely helpful in development of therapeutic\napproaches. Here we review recent developments in experimental and\ncomputational techniques aimed to assess the impact of variants on\nprotein-protein interactions, including limitations and upcoming challenges."}
