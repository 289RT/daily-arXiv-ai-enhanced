Conclusion: 研究揭示了PTPN11错义变异的致病机制差异，并为相关疾病的诊断和治疗提供了分子基础。

Abstract: The PTPN11 gene encodes the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2), a key regulator of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis through its modulation of various signaling pathways, including the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. Missense variants in PTPN11 disrupt SHP2's proper catalytic activity and the regulation of signaling pathways, leading to disorders such as Noonan syndrome (NS), LEOPARD syndrome (LS), or juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). These missense variants have molecular disruptions resulting in gains and losses of function at both the molecular and phenotypic levels. Depending on their location within SHP2, missense substitutions disrupt inter-domain regulation or impair phosphatase function, resulting in altered phosphatase activity. In this study, we investigate the molecular basis underlying the differential pathogenicity of PTPN11 missense variants and predict the structural consequences of these variants using MutPred2 and AlphaFold2. We find that LOF and GOF variants display distinct functional mechanisms in sodium and DNA binding, and that NS-associated missense variants identified in fetuses with ultrasound-detected anomalies and familiar cases are more likely to be pathogenic.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新型铁基气体扩散电极-光催化系统，用于高效降解废水中的酚类化合物，与传统方法相比，降解效率更高且能耗更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 酚类化合物是难生物降解的有毒污染物，现有处理方法（如生物处理和吸附技术）难以实现完全矿化。

Method: 采用双室电化学装置，结合不锈钢毡-2-EAQ气体扩散电极与TiO2光催化技术，显著提升羟基自由基产量。

Result: 在3小时内，优化电流密度（10 mA/cm^2）下，系统对苯酚的降解效率达92%，能耗降低40%，电极稳定性良好（五次循环后活性保持80%以上）。

Conclusion: 该系统为酚类废水处理提供了更高效、可持续的解决方案，兼具降解效率和能源经济性优势。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel iron-based gas diffusion electrode-photocatalytic system aimed at enhancing the degradation of phenolic compounds in wastewater. Phenolic compounds are toxic environmental pollutants with significant resistance to biodegradation. The traditional methods for treating phenol wastewater, including biological treatments and adsorption techniques, often fall short in achieving complete mineralization. Our approach utilizes a dual-chamber electrochemical setup integrating stainless steel felt-2-EAQ gas diffusion electrodes with TiO2 photocatalysis. This combination significantly boosts hydroxyl radical production, critical for effective pollutant breakdown. Experimentally, the system achieved up to 92% degradation efficiency for phenol at an optimized operating current of 10 mA/cm^2 in 3 hours, surpassing traditional methods. Additionally, energy consumption was reduced by 40% compared to conventional electro-Fenton systems. The stability tests indicated that the electrodes maintain over 80% of their initial activity after five cycles of use. These findings suggest that our system offers a more sustainable and efficient solution for treating phenolic wastewater by enhancing both degradation rates and energy efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子动力学模拟产生的高维数据需要简化，内在维度（ID）可以描述构象变化的维度，但目前缺乏直接从轨迹中估计ID的工具。

Method: 结合旋转和平移不变的分子投影（如骨架二面角和残基间距离）与先进的估计器，开发了MDIntrinsicDimension包，提供三种分析模式。

Result: 在DESRES数据集的应用中展示了ID可以揭示空间局部灵活性和结构段差异，补充传统几何描述符。

Conclusion: MDIntrinsicDimension是一个有效的工具，能够直接从分子动力学轨迹中估计ID，并提供更多构象变化的见解。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide atomistic insights into the structure, dynamics, and function of biomolecules by generating time-resolved, high-dimensional trajectories. Analyzing such data benefits from estimating the minimal number of variables required to describe the explored conformational manifold, known as the intrinsic dimension (ID). We present MDIntrinsicDimension, an open-source Python package that estimates ID directly from MD trajectories by combining rotation- and translation-invariant molecular projections (e.g., backbone dihedrals and inter-residue distances) with state-of-the-art estimators. The package provides three complementary analysis modes: whole-molecule ID; sliding windows along the sequence; and per-secondary-structure elements. It computes both overall ID (a single summary value) and instantaneous, time-resolved ID that can reveal transitions and heterogeneity over time. We illustrate the approach on fast folding-unfolding trajectories from the DESRES dataset, demonstrating that ID complements conventional geometric descriptors by highlighting spatially localized flexibility and differences across structural segments.

Result: PIsToN在评分和区分天然对接模型方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PIsToN是一种高效且准确的评分工具，为蛋白质对接领域提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Protein-protein docking is crucial for understanding how proteins interact. Numerous docking tools have been developed to discover possible conformations of two interacting proteins. However, the reliability and success of these docking tools rely on their scoring function. Accurate and efficient scoring functions are necessary to distinguish between native and non-native docking models to ensure the accuracy of a docking tool. Like in other fields where deep learning methods have been successfully utilized, these methods have also introduced innovative scoring functions. An outstanding tool for scoring and differentiating native-like docking models from non-native or incorrect conformations is called Protein binding Interfaces with Transformer Networks (PIsToN). PIsToN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art scoring functions. Using models of complexes obtained from binding the Ebola Virus Protein VP40 to the host cell's Sec24c protein as an example, we show how to evaluate docking models using PIsToN.

Conclusion: cryoSENSE为解决冷冻电镜数据存储和传输瓶颈提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) enables the atomic-resolution visualization of biomolecules; however, modern direct detectors generate data volumes that far exceed the available storage and transfer bandwidth, thereby constraining practical throughput. We introduce cryoSENSE, the computational realization of a hardware-software co-designed framework for compressive cryo-EM sensing and acquisition. We show that cryo-EM images of proteins lie on low-dimensional manifolds that can be independently represented using sparse priors in predefined bases and generative priors captured by a denoising diffusion model. cryoSENSE leverages these low-dimensional manifolds to enable faithful image reconstruction from spatial and Fourier-domain undersampled measurements while preserving downstream structural resolution. In experiments, cryoSENSE increases acquisition throughput by up to 2.5$\times$ while retaining the original 3D resolution, offering controllable trade-offs between the number of masked measurements and the level of downsampling. Sparse priors favor faithful reconstruction from Fourier-domain measurements and moderate compression, whereas generative diffusion priors achieve accurate recovery from pixel-domain measurements and more severe undersampling.
