Protein\nfunction is then regulated through coupling of bindings on the protein\n(allosteric regulation). Just as the genetic code provides the blueprint for\nprotein synthesis, the coupling is thought to provide the basis for protein\ncommunication and interaction. However, it is not yet fully understood how\nbinding of a molecule at one site affects binding of another molecule at\nanother distal site on a protein, even more than $60$ years after its discovery\nin 1961. In this paper, I propose a simple mathematical model of protein\ninteractions, using a ``quantized'' version of differential geometry, i.e., the\ndiscrete differential geometry of $n$-simplices. The model is based on the\nconcept of electron delocalization, one of the main features of quantum\nchemistry, Allosteric regulation then follows tautologically from the\ndefinition of interactions. No prior knowledge of conventional discrete\ndifferential geometry, protein science, or quantum chemistry is required. I\nhope this paper will provide a starting point for many mathematicians to study\nchemistry and molecular biology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u5fae\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u522b\u6784\u8c03\u63a7\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5373\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u4e0a\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f4d\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u522b\u6784\u8c03\u63a7\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u5fae\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fn-\u5355\u5f62\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7535\u5b50\u79bb\u57df\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u522b\u6784\u8c03\u63a7\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6765\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e0c\u671b\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7684\u8d77\u70b9\u3002"}}

In vitro evaluation of 100 designed peptides showed\nlow MIC values (nanomolar range in some cases) for all candidates (100% hit\nrate). Moreover, 99 our of 100 compounds exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial\nactivity against at least two clinically relevant bacteria. The lead molecules\nkilled bacteria primarily by potently targeting the cytoplasmic membrane.
