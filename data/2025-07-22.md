Method: ADFLIP采用离散流匹配技术，逐步整合预测的氨基酸侧链作为结构背景，支持通过多结构态集合采样设计动态蛋白质复合物，并引入无需训练的分类器引导采样以优化序列。

Result: ADFLIP在含小分子配体、核苷酸或金属离子的蛋白质复合物上表现优异，尤其是动态复合物，达到逆蛋白质折叠任务的顶尖水平。

Conclusion: ADFLIP展现了全原子蛋白质设计的巨大潜力，为处理复杂生物分子系统和动态结构提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The recent breakthrough of AlphaFold3 in modeling complex biomolecular
interactions, including those between proteins and ligands, nucleotides, or
metal ions, creates new opportunities for protein design. In so-called inverse
protein folding, the objective is to find a sequence of amino acids that adopts
a target protein structure. Many inverse folding methods struggle to predict
sequences for complexes that contain non-protein components, and perform poorly
with complexes that adopt multiple structural states. To address these
challenges, we present ADFLIP (All-atom Discrete FLow matching Inverse Protein
folding), a generative model based on discrete flow-matching for designing
protein sequences conditioned on all-atom structural contexts. ADFLIP
progressively incorporates predicted amino acid side chains as structural
context during sequence generation and enables the design of dynamic protein
complexes through ensemble sampling across multiple structural states.
Furthermore, ADFLIP implements training-free classifier guidance sampling,
which allows the incorporation of arbitrary pre-trained models to optimise the
designed sequence for desired protein properties. We evaluated the performance
of ADFLIP on protein complexes with small-molecule ligands, nucleotides, or
metal ions, including dynamic complexes for which structure ensembles were
determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-structure and multi-structure inverse
folding tasks, demonstrating excellent potential for all-atom protein design.

TL;DR: 塑料降解的酶法回收面临分子机制理解不足和工艺挑战，需要通过实验与计算方法的结合来解决，以推动可持续发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决塑料回收率低和环境污染问题，探索酶法降解塑料的分子机制，以优化其经济性和可持续性。

Method: 通过跨学科研讨会整合实验与计算方法，深入研究酶降解塑料的分子机制，并提出协同优化工艺设计。

Result: 强调了酶法降解塑料的关键瓶颈，包括分子机制理解不足和工艺挑战，提出了实验与计算结合的解决方案。

Conclusion: 需要继续推动开放合作的生物基塑料回收社区，通过分子水平的理解和工艺优化解决塑料降解问题。

Abstract: Plastics are essential to modern life, yet poor disposal practices contribute
to low recycling rates and environmental accumulation-biological degradation
and by-product reuse offer a path to mitigate this global threat. This report
highlights key insights, future challenges, and research priorities identified
during the CECAM workshop "Computations Meet Experiments to Advance the
Enzymatic Depolymerization of Plastics One Atom at a Time", held in Trieste
from May 6-8, 2025. The workshop brought together an interdisciplinary
community of scientists focused on advancing the sustainable use of plastics
through enzyme-based degradation. A key point from the discussions is that many
bottlenecks in enzymatic recycling arise not only from process engineering
challenges, but also from a limited understanding of the underlying molecular
mechanisms. We argue that constraints on economic viability and sustainability
(e.g., harsh solvents, high temperatures, substrate crystallinity,
pretreatments) can-and should-be addressed directly through enzyme design,
provided these factors are understood at the molecular level, in synergy with
process optimization. For this, it is essential to rely on the integration of
experimental and computational approaches to uncover the molecular and
mechanistic basis of enzymatic plastic degradation. We highlight how the
small-format structure of the workshop, in line with the usual CECAM format,
fostered a collaborative, friendly, and relaxed atmosphere. We hope this report
encourages future initiatives and the formation of shared consortia to support
an open, collaborative, and bio-based plastic recycling community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LFIA在复杂临床应用中灵敏度不足的问题，以满足精准医疗对生物标志物定量检测的需求。

Method: 通过直接吸附法将Bright-Dtech___-614 Europium纳米颗粒与抗体结合，开发了一种高灵敏度的LFIA用于定量人乳酸脱氢酶（h-LDH）。

Result: 新方法的检测灵敏度比传统LFIA（金纳米颗粒）提升了686倍，且具有高准确性和重现性（回收率108±11%，RSD值4.9%-9.7%）。

Conclusion: Bright-Dtech___-614 Europium纳米颗粒的应用显著提升了LFIA的检测限和适用范围，适用于精准医疗。

Abstract: Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) are among the most widely used rapid
diagnostic tests for point-of-care screening of disease biomarkers. However,
their limited sensitivity hinders their use in complex clinical applications
that require accurate biomarker quantification for precise medicine. To address
this limitation, we evaluated Bright-Dtech___-614 Europium nanoparticles to
enhance LFIA assay sensitivity. These nanoparticles exhibited a luminescence
quantum yield of 70 % and a 90 % conjugation efficacy with antibodies by direct
adsorption. Considering these properties, we developed an LFIA to quantify
human lactate dehydrogenase (h-LDH), a biomarker and therapeutic target in
cancer disease. The Bright-Dtech___-614 Eu nanoparticle-based assay achieved a
detection limit of 38 pg mL -1 , representing a 686-fold, 15-fold, and 2.9-fold
improvement in sensitivity over conventional LFIA platforms using gold (AuNPs),
carbon nanoparticles, and standard ELISA, respectively. The assay exhibited
strong accuracy, with a mean recovery rate of 108 $\pm$ 11 %, and demonstrated
excellent reproducibility, as evidenced by inter-and intra-batch RSD values of
4.9 % and 9.7 %, respectively, when testing LDH-spiked serum samples. By
substituting traditional gold nanoparticles with the Bright-Dtech___-614 Eu
nanoparticles, we achieved detection limits in the femtomolar range,
significantly broadening the applicability of LFIA for precision medicine.

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of nanomaterials in medicine and environmental
science hinges on understanding their interactions with proteins, a complex
decision space where AI is poised to make a transformative impact. However,
progress has been hindered by limited datasets and the restricted
generalizability of existing models. Here, we propose NanoPro-3M, the largest
nanomaterial-protein interaction dataset to date, comprising over 3.2 million
samples and 37,000 unique proteins. Leveraging this, we present NanoProFormer,
a foundational model that predicts nanomaterial-protein affinities through
multimodal representation learning, demonstrating strong generalization,
handling missing features, and unseen nanomaterials or proteins. We show that
multimodal modeling significantly outperforms single-modality approaches and
identifies key determinants of corona formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate
its applicability to a range of downstream tasks through zero-shot inference
and fine-tuning. Together, this work establishes a solid foundation for
high-performance and generalized prediction of nanomaterial-protein interaction
endpoints, reducing experimental reliance and accelerating various in vitro
applications.

Abstract: Detecting stress in plants is crucial for both open-farm and
controlled-environment agriculture. Biomolecules within plants serve as key
stress indicators, offering vital markers for continuous health monitoring and
early disease detection. Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful, non-invasive
means to quantify these biomolecules through their molecular vibrational
signatures. However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized
data-processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and
prior identification of Raman peaks of interest-introducing potential biases
and inconsistencies. Here, we introduce DIVA (Deep-learning-based Investigation
of Vibrational Raman spectra for plant-stress Analysis), a fully automated
workflow based on a variational autoencoder. Unlike conventional approaches,
DIVA processes native Raman spectra-including fluorescence backgrounds-without
manual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spectral features
in an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses,
including abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic
stressors (bacterial infections). By integrating deep learning with vibrational
spectroscopy, DIVA paves the way for AI-driven plant health assessment,
fostering more resilient and sustainable agricultural practices.
