Motivation: 生成式AI在蛋白质设计中表现优异，但传统模型倾向于高概率区域，难以探索低概率但有价值的蛋白质特性。因此，需要方法引导模型生成具备罕见或指定特性的蛋白质。

Method: 本文区分了两类方法：1）修改模型参数（如强化学习、监督微调）；2）固定模型（如条件生成、检索增强策略、贝叶斯引导和定制采样方法）。

Result: 这些方法开始能够引导生成模型生成具有所需特性且传统方法难以实现的蛋白质。

Conclusion: 通过不同条件生成技术，生成式AI在蛋白质设计中展现出更大潜力，能够探索并实现更广泛的蛋白质特性。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models learn probability distributions from data and produce novel samples that capture the salient properties of their training sets. Proteins are particularly attractive for such approaches given their abundant data and the versatility of their representations, ranging from sequences to structures and functions. This versatility has motivated the rapid development of generative models for protein design, enabling the generation of functional proteins and enzymes with unprecedented success. However, because these models mirror their training distribution, they tend to sample from its most probable modes, while low-probability regions, often encoding valuable properties, remain underexplored. To address this challenge, recent work has focused on guiding generative models to produce proteins with user-specified properties, even when such properties are rare or absent from the original training distribution. In this review, we survey and categorize recent advances in conditioning generative models for protein design. We distinguish approaches that modify model parameters, such as reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning, from those that keep the model fixed, including conditional generation, retrieval-augmented strategies, Bayesian guidance, and tailored sampling methods. Together, these developments are beginning to enable the steering of generative models toward proteins with desired, and often previously inaccessible, properties.
