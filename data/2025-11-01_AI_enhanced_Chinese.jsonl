For example, Markov models for ion\nchannels often consist of multiple open and closed state to account for \"slow\"\nand \"fast\" openings and closings of the channel. The approach is a popular tool\nin the construction of mechanistic models of ion channels - instead of viewing\nmodel states as generators of sojourn times of a certain characteristic length,\neach individual model state is interpreted as a representation of a distinct\nbiophysical state. We will review the properties of aggregated Markov models\nand discuss the implications for mechanistic modelling. First, we show how the\naggregated Markov models with a given number of states can be calculated using\nP\\'olya enumeration However, models with $n_O$ open and $n_C$ closed states\nthat exceed the maximum number $2 n_O n_C$ of parameters are non-identifiable.\nWe will present two derivations for this classical result and investigate\nnon-identifiability further via a detailed analysis of the non-identifiable\nfully connected three-state model. Finally, we will discuss the implications of\nnon-identifiability for mechanistic modelling of ion channels. We will argue\nthat instead of designing models based on assumed transitions between distinct\nbiophysical states which are modulated by ligand binding, it is preferable to\nbuild models based on additional sources of data that give more direct insight\ninto the dynamics of conformational changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u805a\u5408\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u5bf9\u673a\u68b0\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u53c2\u6570\u8fc7\u591a\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u5408\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u79bb\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u673a\u68b0\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7P\u00f3lya\u679a\u4e3e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u975e\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u4e09\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u57fa\u4e8e\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u800c\u975e\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u72b6\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}
