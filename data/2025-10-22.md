Abstract: Building a working mental model of a protein typically requires weeks of
reading, cross-referencing crystal and predicted structures, and inspecting
ligand complexes, an effort that is slow, unevenly accessible, and often
requires specialized computational skills. We introduce \emph{Speak to a
Protein}, a new capability that turns protein analysis into an interactive,
multimodal dialogue with an expert co-scientist. The AI system retrieves and
synthesizes relevant literature, structures, and ligand data; grounds answers
in a live 3D scene; and can highlight, annotate, manipulate and see the
visualization. It also generates and runs code when needed, explaining results
in both text and graphics. We demonstrate these capabilities on relevant
proteins, posing questions about binding pockets, conformational changes, or
structure-activity relationships to test ideas in real-time. \emph{Speak to a
Protein} reduces the time from question to evidence, lowers the barrier to
advanced structural analysis, and enables hypothesis generation by tightly
coupling language, code, and 3D structures. \emph{Speak to a Protein} is freely
accessible at https://open.playmolecule.org.
