Abstract: Biomolecular interaction modeling has been substantially advanced by
foundation models, yet they often produce all-atom structures that violate
basic steric feasibility. We address this limitation by enforcing physical
validity as a strict constraint during both training and inference with a
uniffed module. At its core is a differentiable projection that maps the
provisional atom coordinates from the diffusion model to the nearest physically
valid conffguration. This projection is achieved using a Gauss-Seidel scheme,
which exploits the locality and sparsity of the constraints to ensure stable
and fast convergence at scale. By implicit differentiation to obtain gradients,
our module integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks for end-to-end
ffnetuning. With our Gauss-Seidel projection module in place, two denoising
steps are sufffcient to produce biomolecular complexes that are both physically
valid and structurally accurate. Across six benchmarks, our 2-step model
achieves the same structural accuracy as state-of-the-art 200-step diffusion
baselines, delivering approximately 10 times faster wall-clock speed while
guaranteeing physical validity.

Abstract: Biomolecules exhibit a remarkable property of transforming signals from their
environment. This paper presents a communication system design using a
light-modulated protein channel: Synthetic Photoisomerizable
Azobenzene-regulated K+ (SPARK). Our approach involves a comprehensive design
incorporating the SPARK-based receiver, encoding methods, modulation
techniques, and detection processes. By analyzing the resulting communication
system, we determine how different parameters influence its performance.
Furthermore, we explore the potential design in terms of bioengineering and
demonstrate that the data rate scales up with the number of receptors,
indicating the possibility of achieving high-speed communication.

Abstract: DNA strand displacement (SD) reactions are central to the operation of many
synthetic nucleic acid systems, including molecular circuits, sensors, and
machines. Over the years, a broad set of design frameworks has emerged to
accommodate various functional goals, initial configurations, and environmental
conditions. Nevertheless, key challenges persist, particularly in reliably
predicting reaction kinetics. This review examines recent approaches to SD
reaction design, with emphasis on the properties of single reactions, including
kinetics, structural factors, and limitations in current modelling practices.
We identify promising innovations while analysing the factors that continue to
hinder predictive accuracy. We conclude by outlining future directions for
achieving more robust and programmable behaviour in DNA-based systems.
