Such systems are modeled by PDE ODE couplings that combine three dimensional diffusion with nonlinear intracellular dynamics, making analysis and simulation challenging. We show that the diffusion dynamics converges exponentially to a quasi steady spatial profile and use singular perturbation theory to reduce the model to a finite dimensional multiagent network. A closed form communication matrix derived from the spherical Green's function captures the effective sender receiver coupling. Numerical results show the reduced model closely matches the full dynamics while enabling scalable simulation of large cell populations."}

However, the black-box nature of state-of-the-art models remains a significant barrier to adoption, as high-stakes safety decisions demand verifiable structural insights alongside predictive performance. To address this, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework designed to jointly enhance accuracy and interpretability. Our architecture integrates a shared chemical language model with task-specific attention modules. By imposing an L1 sparsity penalty on these modules, the framework is constrained to focus on a minimal set of salient molecular fragments for each distinct toxicity endpoint. The resulting framework is trained end-to-end and is readily adaptable to various transformer-based backbones. Evaluated on the ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 benchmark datasets, our approach consistently outperforms both single-task and standard MTL baselines. Crucially, the sparse attention weights provide chemically intuitive visualizations that reveal the specific fragments influencing predictions, thereby enhancing insight into the model's decision-making process."}
