However, many current models are computationally expensive,\nrequiring hundreds or even thousands of function evaluations (NFEs) to yield\nsamples of acceptable quality, which can become a bottleneck in practical\ndesign campaigns that often generate $10^4\\ -\\ 10^6$ designs per target. In\nimage generation, Rectified Flows (ReFlow) can significantly reduce the\nrequired NFEs for a given target quality, but their application in protein\nbackbone generation has been less studied. We apply ReFlow to improve the low\nNFE performance of pretrained SE(3) flow matching models for protein backbone\ngeneration and systematically study ReFlow design choices in the context of\nprotein generation in data curation, training and inference time settings. In\nparticular, we (1) show that ReFlow in the protein domain is particularly\nsensitive to the choice of coupling generation and annealing, (2) demonstrate\nhow useful design choices for ReFlow in the image domain do not directly\ntranslate to better performance on proteins, and (3) make improvements to\nReFlow methodology for proteins.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7Rectified Flows (ReFlow)\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9aa8\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\uff08NFEs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9886\u57df\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9aa8\u67b6\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982Diffusion\u548cFlow Matching\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11NFEs\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528ReFlow\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SE(3) flow matching\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0ReFlow\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u8026\u5408\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9000\u706b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e14\u56fe\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbReFlow\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9aa8\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Current generative\nmodels excel in protein design but face limitations in binding data,\nsubstrate-specific control, and flexibility for de novo enzyme backbone\ngeneration. To address this, we introduce EnzyBind, a dataset with 11,100\nexperimentally validated enzyme-substrate pairs specifically curated from\nPDBbind. Building on this, we propose EnzyControl, a method that enables\nfunctional and substrate-specific control in enzyme backbone generation. Our\napproach generates enzyme backbones conditioned on MSA-annotated catalytic\nsites and their corresponding substrates, which are automatically extracted\nfrom curated enzyme-substrate data. At the core of EnzyControl is EnzyAdapter,\na lightweight, modular component integrated into a pretrained motif-scaffolding\nmodel, allowing it to become substrate-aware. A two-stage training paradigm\nfurther refines the model's ability to generate accurate and functional enzyme\nstructures. Experiments show that our EnzyControl achieves the best performance\nacross structural and functional metrics on EnzyBind and EnzyBench benchmarks,\nwith particularly notable improvements of 13\\% in designability and 13\\% in\ncatalytic efficiency compared to the baseline models.
