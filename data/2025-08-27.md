Conclusion: AlphaFold 3不仅是蛋白质结构预测的突破，还为深度学习与物理模拟的结合提供了新方向。

Abstract: AlphaFold 3 represents a transformative advancement in computational biology,
enhancing protein structure prediction through novel multi-scale transformer
architectures, biologically informed cross-attention mechanisms, and
geometry-aware optimization strategies. These innovations dramatically improve
predictive accuracy and generalization across diverse protein families,
surpassing previous methods. Crucially, AlphaFold 3 embodies a paradigm shift
toward differentiable simulation, bridging traditional static structural
modeling with dynamic molecular simulations. By reframing protein folding
predictions as a differentiable process, AlphaFold 3 serves as a foundational
framework for integrating deep learning with physics-based molecular

*Emery T. Usher,Jacqueline F. Pelham*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 本文总结了内在无序蛋白区域（IDRs）在生物节律钟中的关键作用及其调控机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究IDRs在生物节律钟中的功能和调控机制，因IDRs广泛存在于从真菌到哺乳动物的核心时钟蛋白中，对时间保持和调控至关重要。

Method: 综述了IDRs的生物物理机制及其调节因子，分析了IDRs在时钟蛋白中的广泛分布和功能。

Result: IDRs作为动态交互模块在生物节律钟的激活和抑制中发挥关键作用，支持精确的时间调控并扩展输出信号。

Conclusion: IDRs在核心时钟及其以外的调控中具有重要作用，强调了其在生物节律机制中的多功能性。

Abstract: Intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are found across all domains
of life and are characterized by a lack of stable 3D structure. Nevertheless,
IDRs play critical roles in the most tightly regulated cellular processes,
including in the core circadian clock. The molecular oscillator at the heart of
circadian regulation leverages IDRs as dynamic interaction modules for
activation and repression to support robust timekeeping and expand clock output
and regulation. Here, we cover the biophysical mechanisms conferred by IDRs and
their modulators. We survey the intrinsically disordered regions in clock
proteins that are widely prevalent from fungi to mammals and discuss the
importance of IDRs to the core clock and beyond.

*RMHKK Rajapaksha,EMN Fernando,AWMKK Bandara,NRM Nelumdeniya,ARN Silva*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 研究评估了Horsfieldia iryaghedhi的甲醇和水提取物对革兰氏阳性菌的抗菌效果，发现其对金黄色葡萄球菌有效，但对大肠杆菌无效，建议进一步分析甲醇提取物的潜在抗生素开发价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多药耐药细菌的威胁急需新的治疗替代品，植物中未被探索的植物化学物质具有治疗潜力。

Method: 通过冷浸法获得提取物，采用孔扩散法测试对金黄色葡萄球菌和大肠杆菌的抗菌活性。

Result: 甲醇叶和组合提取物对金黄色葡萄球菌有抗菌活性，但对大肠杆菌无效。

Conclusion: H. iryaghedhi的甲醇提取物值得进一步研究，可能开发为抗生素。

Abstract: Aims: Over the past two decades, the rise of multidrug resistance (MDR) in
bacteria has posed a significant threat to global health. The urgent need for
new treatment alternatives has brought attention to the potential of plants,
which harbor a wealth of unexplored phytochemicals with therapeutic properties.
This study aims to evaluate the anti-bacterial efficacy of methanol and aqueous
extracts from the leaves and bark of Horsfieldia iryaghedhi In vitro.
Methodology: Aqueous and methanol extracts were obtained from the cold
maceration method. In vitro anti-bacterial activity of methanol and aqueous
leaf, bark, and combination extracts were determined against gram-negative
bacteria Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and gram-positive bacteria
Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923). The anti-bacterial assay for different
concentrations of each extract was conducted through the well-diffusion method,
with Gentamycin serving as the positive control. Results: Methanol leaf and
combination extracts of Horsfieldia iryaghedhi have shown a positive
anti-bacterial response at their highest concentrations of 1000mcg/mL and
500mcg/mL against grampositive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus while none of the
extracts showed anti-bacterial activity against gram-negative E. coli at the
experimented concentrations. Conclusion: The study concludes that methanol
extracts of H.iryaghedhi should be further analyzed for their anti-bacterial
activity, and there could be potential lead molecules that can be developed as
antibiotics

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证传统医学中使用Asystasia variabilis治疗伤口感染的疗效，并探索其潜在的新型药物开发价值。

Method: 采用Kirby-Bauer纸片扩散法测试提取物对四种细菌的抗菌活性，并以庆大霉素和蒸馏水作为对照。植物化学成分通过定性分析确定。

Result: 提取物对所有测试细菌均表现出浓度依赖的抗菌活性，对B. subtilis效果最强。植物化学分析显示含多种活性成分。

Conclusion: 研究证实Asystasia variabilis提取物具有显著的抗菌效果，可能通过多种成分协同作用实现，为其传统药用价值提供了科学依据，并展示了新药开发的潜力。

Abstract: This study evaluated the in vitro antibacterial effect and the phytochemical
profile of aqueous extract of fresh mature leaves of Asystasia variabilis, a
Sri Lankan indigenous plant, against four common wound infective bacteria
(Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Escherichia coli) using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test. Gentamicin 10 {\mu}g/
disk and distilled water was used as positive and negative controls
respectively The study revealed, for the first time, that the extract possessed
significant antibacterial activity against all four test organisms in a
concentration dependent manner (r values ranging from 0.921-0.992, P<0.01) with
inhibition zone diameters ranging between 8 and 28 mm. Highest antibacterial
activity was exhibited against B. subtilis at 1000 {\mu}g/ disk (27.43-+0.02
mm). The extract showed inhibitory effects comparable to gentamicin towards B.
subtilis and P. aeruginosa at 500 {\mu}g/ disk and towards E. coli and S.
aureus at 1000 {\mu}g/ disk. Qualitative phytochemical screening revealed the
presence of flavonoids, tannins, phenols, cardiac glycosides, amino acids,
carbohydrates, alkaloids and saponins. Therefore it is likely that the
antibacterial effect of the extract is mediated by synergistic mechanisms.
Furthermore, results of this study scientifically justified the claim
traditional and folk medicine in the treatment of abscesses, wounds and ulcers
and indicated the potential for the development of a novel drug from mature
leaves of Asystasia variabilis.
