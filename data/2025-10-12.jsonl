The strength of an interaction, typically given by\nthe dissociation constant (KD), plays a crucial role in basic research and must\nbe monitored throughout the development of drugs and agrochemicals. An ideal\nmethod for KD determination is applicable to various analytes with a large\nrange of affinities, tolerates complex matrix compositions, does not require\nlabeling, and simultaneously provides information on the structural integrity\nof the binding partners. Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but\ntypically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass\nsignals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to\noverlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of\neach oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking.\nFollowing this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead\nIon Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the\naffinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of\nTryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei\nparasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities. Conveniently,\nqLILBID-MS requires a fraction of sample used by other methods such as\nisothermal titration calorimetry and yields previously inaccessible protein\nhomodimer KDs in the high micromolar range, which allowed us to monitor the\ngradual decrease in homodimer affinity via mutation of crucial dimer interface\ncontacts. Overall, qLILBID-MS is a sensitive, robust, fast, scalable, and\ncost-effective alternative to quantify protein/protein interactions that can\naccelerate contemporary drug discovery workflows, e.g. the efficient screening\nfor proximity inducing molecules like proteolysis targeting chimera and\nmolecular glues."}
