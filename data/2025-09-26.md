Abstract: Structural prediction of protein-protein interactions is important to
understand the molecular basis of cellular interactions, but it still faces
major challenges when significant conformational changes are present. We
propose a generative framework of hierarchical adaptive diffusion to improve
accuracy and efficiency in such cases. It is hierarchical in separating global
inter-protein rigid-body motions and local intra-protein flexibility in
diffusion processes, and the distinct local and global noise schedules are
designed to mimic the induced-fit effect. It is adaptive in conditioning the
local flexibility schedule on predicted levels of conformational change,
allowing faster flexing for larger anticipated conformational changes.
Furthermore, it couples the local and global diffusion processes through a
common score and confidence network with sequence, evolution, structure, and
dynamics features as inputs, and maintains rotational or translational
invariance or equivariance in outputs. It builds on our newly curated DIPS-AF
dataset of nearly 39,000 examples for pre-training. Experiments on the
independent docking benchmark dataset DB5.5 show that our model outperforms an
AlphaFold2-like iterative transformer (GeoDock) and a diffusion model
(DiffDock-PP) in both rigid and flexible cases, with larger improvements in
more flexible cases. Ablation studies prove the importance of adaptive
schedules, dynamics features, and pre-training. Additional analyses and case
studies reveal remaining gaps in sampling, scoring, and conformational
resolution.
