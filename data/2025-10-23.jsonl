However, current molecular\nlarge language models face significant limitations in understanding molecules\ndue to inadequate textual descriptions and suboptimal molecular representation\nstrategies during pretraining. To address these challenges, we introduce\nKnowMol-100K, a large-scale dataset with 100K fine-grained molecular\nannotations across multiple levels, bridging the gap between molecules and\ntextual descriptions. Additionally, we propose chemically-informative molecular\nrepresentation, effectively addressing limitations in existing molecular\nrepresentation strategies. Building upon these innovations, we develop KnowMol,\na state-of-the-art multi-modal molecular large language model. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that KnowMol achieves superior performance across\nmolecular understanding and generation tasks.\n  GitHub: https://github.com/yzf-code/KnowMol\n  Huggingface: https://hf.co/datasets/yzf1102/KnowMol-100K"}

Recent advances in stabilizing mammalian\nolfactory receptors and integrating them into biophotonic and bioelectronic\nsystems have enabled detection at near single-molecule resolution thus placing\nmachines on par with trained detection dogs. As this technology converges with\nmultimodal AI and distributed sensor networks imbued with embedded AI, it\nintroduces a new, biochemical layer to a sensing ecosystem currently dominated\nby machine vision and audition. This review and industry roadmap surveys the\nscientific foundations, technological frontiers, and strategic applications of\nmachine olfaction making the case that we are currently witnessing the rise of\na new industry that brings with it a global chemosensory infrastructure. We\ncover exemplary industrial, military and consumer applications and address some\nof the ethical and legal concerns arising. We find that machine olfaction is\npoised to bring forth a planet-wide molecular awareness tech layer with the\npotential of spawning vast emerging markets in health, security, and\nenvironmental sensing via scent."}
