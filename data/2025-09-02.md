Result: 实验表明，利用肽特异性信息的模型显著优于仅依赖全局统计的方法，且性能随模型容量增加而提升，显示肽-碎片关系具有复杂非线性。

Conclusion: Pep2Prob为提升MS²分析中肽识别准确性提供了新工具，并表明复杂的机器学习方法在这一领域的重要性。

Abstract: Proteins perform nearly all cellular functions and constitute most drug
targets, making their analysis fundamental to understanding human biology in
health and disease. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS$^2$) is the major analytical
technique in proteomics that identifies peptides by ionizing them, fragmenting
them, and using the resulting mass spectra to identify and quantify proteins in
biological samples. In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability
prediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide
identification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information.
Current approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes
that a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides. Nevertheless,
this assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view
and limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the
first comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific
fragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion
probability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair
of peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million
high-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide
assignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance
using simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models
leveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous
methods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance
across benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the
peptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring
sophisticated machine learning approaches.

Abstract: Cryptochrome flavoproteins are prime candidates for mediating magnetic
sensing in migratory animals via the radical pair mechanism (RPM), a
spin-dependent process initiated by photoinduced electron transfer. The
canonical FAD-tryptophan radical pair exhibits pronounced anisotropic hyperfine
couplings, enabling sensitivity to geomagnetic fields. However, maintaining
spin coherence under physiological conditions and explaining responses to weak
radiofrequency fields remain unresolved challenges. Alternative radicals, such
as superoxide and ascorbate, have been proposed to enhance anisotropy or
suppress decoherence. This review summarizes the quantum basis of
magnetoreception, evaluates both canonical and alternative radical pair models,
and discusses amplification strategies including triads, spin scavenging, and
bystander radicals. Emphasis is placed on how molecular geometry, exchange and
dipolar interactions, and hyperfine topology modulate magnetic sensitivity. Key
open questions and future directions are outlined, highlighting the need for
structural and dynamical data under physiological conditions.

### [3] [ImmunoAI: Accelerated Antibody Discovery Using Gradient-Boosted Machine Learning with Thermodynamic-Hydrodynamic Descriptors and 3D Geometric Interface Topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21082)
*Shawnak Shivakumar,Matthew Sandora*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: ImmunoAI利用机器学习加速抗体发现，通过预测高亲和力抗体候选，显著缩短设计周期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抗体发现流程耗时过长，无法快速应对病毒爆发，因此开发了ImmunoAI以加速这一过程。

Method: 使用梯度提升模型（LightGBM）训练几何和物理化学特征，预测抗体-抗原结合亲和力。

Result: 模型将抗体候选范围缩小89%，并在SARS-CoV-2数据上进一步优化RMSE至0.92，预测出两种对hMPV A2.2变体具有皮摩尔级亲和力的抗体。

Conclusion: ImmunoAI能够快速响应病毒爆发，提供结构信息化的抗体设计解决方案。

Abstract: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) poses serious risks to pediatric, elderly, and
immunocompromised populations. Traditional antibody discovery pipelines require
10-12 months, limiting their applicability for rapid outbreak response. This
project introduces ImmunoAI, a machine learning framework that accelerates
antibody discovery by predicting high-affinity candidates using
gradient-boosted models trained on thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D
topological interface descriptors. A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes
was curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM
regressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The
model reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on
117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from
1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2
variant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model
identified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting
key mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for
experimental testing. In summary, ImmunoAI shortens design cycles and enables
faster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks.
