ICLR 2025", "summary": "Molecular docking is a cornerstone of drug discovery, relying on\nhigh-resolution ligand-bound structures to achieve accurate predictions.\nHowever, obtaining these structures is often costly and time-intensive,\nlimiting their availability. In contrast, ligand-free structures are more\naccessible but suffer from reduced docking performance due to pocket geometries\nbeing less suited for ligand accommodation in apo structures. Traditional\nmethods for artificially inducing these conformations, such as molecular\ndynamics simulations, are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce\nSesame, a generative model designed to predict this conformational change\nefficiently. By generating geometries better suited for ligand accommodation at\na fraction of the computational cost, Sesame aims to provide a scalable\nsolution for improving virtual screening workflows."}

The relevance and value of\nthese structures is directly related to their ability to help rationalize\nexperimental observables, which in turn depends on the quality of model built\ninto the density map.

Because of the high costs associated\nwith mammalian cell cultures, obtaining high cell densities to produce high\nproduct titers is desired. These bioprocesses require high concentrations of\nnutrients in the basal media and periodically adding concentrated feed media to\nsustain cell growth and therapeutic protein productivity. Unfortunately, the\ndesired or optimal nutrient concentrations of the feed media are often\nsolubility limited due to precipitation of chemical complexes that form in the\nsolution. Experimentally screening the various cell culture media\nconfigurations which contain 50 to 100 compounds can be expensive and\nlaborious. This article lays the foundation for utilizing computational tools\nto understand precipitation of nutrients in cell culture media by studying the\npairwise interactions between amino acids in thermodynamic models. Activity\ncoefficient data for one amino acid in water and amino acid solubility data of\ntwo amino acids in water have been used to determine a single set of UNIFAC\ngroup interaction parameters to predict the thermodynamic behavior of the\nmulti-component systems found in mammalian cell culture media. The data\ncollected in this study is, to our knowledge, the largest set of ternary system\namino acid solubility data reported to date. These amino acid precipitation\npredictions have been verified with experimentally measured ternary and\nquaternary amino acid solutions. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of our model\nas a digital twin to identify optimal cell culture media compositions by\nreplacing empirical approaches for nutrient precipitation with computational\npredictions based on thermodynamics of individual media components in complex\nmixtures."}

As parts of these search tools, alignment\nscores and E values are useful indicators of the quality of search results from\nquerying a database of annotated sequences, whereby a high alignment score (and\ninversely a low E value) reflects significant similarity between the query and\nthe subject (target) sequences. For cross-comparison of results from\nsufficiently different queries however, the interpretation of alignment score\nas a similarity measure and E value a dissimilarity measure becomes somewhat\nnuanced, and prompts herein a judicious distinction of different types of\nsimilarity. We show that an adjustment of E value to account for self-matching\nof query and subject sequences corrects for certain ostensibly anomalous\nsimilarity comparisons, resulting in canonical dissimilarity and similarity\nmeasures that would be more appropriate for database applications, such as\nall-on-all sequence alignment or selection of diverse subsets. In actual\npractice, the canonicalization of E value dissimilarity improves clustering and\nthe diversity of subset selection. While both E value and the canonical E value\nshare positivity and symmetry, two of the four axiomatic properties of a metric\nspace, the canonical E value itself is also reflexive and meets the condition\nof triangle inequality, thus an appropriate distance function for a metric\nspace of protein sequences."}

Existing sequence or structure\nmethods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific\nbinding sites on the antigens-a dual limitation in representation and\nprediction. In this paper, we propose CAME-AB, a novel Cross-modality Attention\nframework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding\nsite prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities,\nincluding raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained\nlanguage model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined\nbiochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance\nadaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module\nthat learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance\nand input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE\nmodule further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We\nadditionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to\nexplicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness\nand inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and\ngeneralization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB\nconsistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including\nPrecision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further\nvalidate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of\nmultimodal feature integration.
