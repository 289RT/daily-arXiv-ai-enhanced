Here we introduce a new research direction that directly\nleverages physical observables from nature--the amplitude of Turing\npatterns--to achieve complete parameter identification. We present a framework\nthat uses the spatial amplitude profile of a single pattern to simultaneously\nrecover all system parameters, including wavelength, diffusion constants, and\nthe full nonlinear forms of chemotactic and kinetic coefficient functions.\nDemonstrated on models of chemotactic bacteria, this amplitude-based approach\nestablishes a biologically grounded, mathematically rigorous paradigm for\nreverse-engineering pattern formation mechanisms across diverse biological\nsystems."}

We present LSMTCR, a scalable multi-architecture\nframework that separates specificity from constraint learning to enable de\nnovo, epitope-conditioned generation of paired, full-length TCRs. A\ndiffusion-enhanced BERT encoder learns time-conditioned epitope\nrepresentations; conditional GPT decoders, pretrained on CDR3\\b{eta} and\ntransferred to CDR3{\\alpha}, generate chain-specific CDR3s under cross-modal\nconditioning with temperature-controlled diversity; and a gene-aware\nTransformer assembles complete {\\alpha}/\\b{eta} sequences by predicting V/J\nusage to ensure immunogenetic fidelity. Across GLIPH, TEP, MIRA, McPAS and our\ncurated dataset, LSMTCR achieves higher predicted binding than baselines on\nmost datasets, more faithfully recovers positional and length grammars, and\ndelivers superior, temperature-tunable diversity. For {\\alpha}-chain\ngeneration, transfer learning improves predicted binding, length realism and\ndiversity over representative methods. Full-length assembly from known or de\nnovo CDR3s preserves k-mer spectra, yields low edit distances to references,\nand, in paired {\\alpha}/\\b{eta} co-modelling with epitope, attains higher\npTM/ipTM than single-chain settings. LSMTCR outputs diverse,\ngene-contextualized, full-length TCR designs from epitope input alone, enabling\nhigh-throughput screening and iterative optimization."}
