Learned features\ndemonstrate state of the art performance on a range of predictive tasks\nincluding molecular properties, structure generation, and protein-ligand\ninteractions. The majority of approaches are limited by their use of static\nstructures and it remains an open question, how best to use atomistic molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations to develop more generalized models to improve\nprediction accuracy for novel molecular structures. We present SURrogate mmGBSA\n(SurGBSA) as a new modeling approach for MD-based representation learning,\nwhich learns a surrogate function of the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born\nSurface Area (MMGBSA). We show for the first time the benefits of\nphysics-informed pre-training to train a surrogate MMGBSA model on a collection\nof over 1.4 million 3D trajectories collected from MD simulations of the\nCASF-2016 benchmark. SurGBSA demonstrates a dramatic 6,497x speedup versus a\ntraditional physics-based single-point MMGBSA calculation while nearly matching\nsingle-point MMGBSA accuracy on the challenging pose ranking problem for\nidentification of the correct top pose (-0.4% difference). Our work advances\nthe development of molecular foundation models by showing model improvements\nwhen training on MD simulations. Models, code and training data are made\npublicly available."}
