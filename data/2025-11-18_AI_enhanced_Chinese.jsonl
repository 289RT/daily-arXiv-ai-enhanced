Missense variants in PTPN11 disrupt SHP2's proper catalytic activity and the regulation of signaling pathways, leading to disorders such as Noonan syndrome (NS), LEOPARD syndrome (LS), or juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). These missense variants have molecular disruptions resulting in gains and losses of function at both the molecular and phenotypic levels. Depending on their location within SHP2, missense substitutions disrupt inter-domain regulation or impair phosphatase function, resulting in altered phosphatase activity. In this study, we investigate the molecular basis underlying the differential pathogenicity of PTPN11 missense variants and predict the structural consequences of these variants using MutPred2 and AlphaFold2. We find that LOF and GOF variants display distinct functional mechanisms in sodium and DNA binding, and that NS-associated missense variants identified in fetuses with ultrasound-detected anomalies and familiar cases are more likely to be pathogenic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86PTPN11\u57fa\u56e0\u9519\u4e49\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9SHP2\u86cb\u767d\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u4e27\u5931\uff08LOF\uff09\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\uff08GOF\uff09\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u540e\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "PTPN11\u57fa\u56e0\u7684\u9519\u4e49\u53d8\u5f02\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\uff08\u5982Noonan\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u3001LEOPARD\u7efc\u5408\u5f81\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5206\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u81f4\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MutPred2\u548cAlphaFold2\u5206\u6790PTPN11\u9519\u4e49\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LOF\u548cGOF\u53d8\u5f02\u5728\u94a0\u548cDNA\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u5f02\u5e38\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u81f4\u75c5\u6027\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86PTPN11\u9519\u4e49\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u81f4\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Phenolic compounds are toxic environmental pollutants with significant resistance to biodegradation. The traditional methods for treating phenol wastewater, including biological treatments and adsorption techniques, often fall short in achieving complete mineralization. Our approach utilizes a dual-chamber electrochemical setup integrating stainless steel felt-2-EAQ gas diffusion electrodes with TiO2 photocatalysis. This combination significantly boosts hydroxyl radical production, critical for effective pollutant breakdown. Experimentally, the system achieved up to 92% degradation efficiency for phenol at an optimized operating current of 10 mA/cm^2 in 3 hours, surpassing traditional methods. Additionally, energy consumption was reduced by 40% compared to conventional electro-Fenton systems. The stability tests indicated that the electrodes maintain over 80% of their initial activity after five cycles of use. These findings suggest that our system offers a more sustainable and efficient solution for treating phenolic wastewater by enhancing both degradation rates and energy efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u94c1\u57fa\u6c14\u4f53\u6269\u6563\u7535\u6781-\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u964d\u89e3\u5e9f\u6c34\u4e2d\u7684\u915a\u7c7b\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u964d\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u80fd\u8017\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u915a\u7c7b\u5316\u5408\u7269\u662f\u96be\u751f\u7269\u964d\u89e3\u7684\u6709\u6bd2\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u751f\u7269\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5438\u9644\u6280\u672f\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u77ff\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5ba4\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u88c5\u7f6e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u9508\u94a2\u6be1-2-EAQ\u6c14\u4f53\u6269\u6563\u7535\u6781\u4e0eTiO2\u5149\u50ac\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f9f\u57fa\u81ea\u7531\u57fa\u4ea7\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u57283\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u6d41\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0810 mA/cm^2\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u82ef\u915a\u7684\u964d\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u8fbe92%\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e40%\uff0c\u7535\u6781\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u826f\u597d\uff08\u4e94\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u540e\u6d3b\u6027\u4fdd\u630180%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u915a\u7c7b\u5e9f\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u964d\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We present MDIntrinsicDimension, an open-source Python package that estimates ID directly from MD trajectories by combining rotation- and translation-invariant molecular projections (e.g., backbone dihedrals and inter-residue distances) with state-of-the-art estimators. The package provides three complementary analysis modes: whole-molecule ID; sliding windows along the sequence; and per-secondary-structure elements. It computes both overall ID (a single summary value) and instantaneous, time-resolved ID that can reveal transitions and heterogeneity over time.

We introduce cryoSENSE, the computational realization of a hardware-software co-designed framework for compressive cryo-EM sensing and acquisition. We show that cryo-EM images of proteins lie on low-dimensional manifolds that can be independently represented using sparse priors in predefined bases and generative priors captured by a denoising diffusion model. cryoSENSE leverages these low-dimensional manifolds to enable faithful image reconstruction from spatial and Fourier-domain undersampled measurements while preserving downstream structural resolution. In experiments, cryoSENSE increases acquisition throughput by up to 2.5$\\times$ while retaining the original 3D resolution, offering controllable trade-offs between the number of masked measurements and the level of downsampling. Sparse priors favor faithful reconstruction from Fourier-domain measurements and moderate compression, whereas generative diffusion priors achieve accurate recovery from pixel-domain measurements and more severe undersampling.
