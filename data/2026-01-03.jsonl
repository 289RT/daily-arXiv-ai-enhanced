We demonstrate how to repurpose a cutting-edge folding architecture into a powerful generative design framework by effectively integrating self-conditioning features. Extensive benchmarks highlight the model's capabilities across two distinct tasks: in unconditional generation, SeedProteo exhibits superior length generalization and structural diversity, maintaining robustness for long sequences and complex topologies; in binder design, it achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods, attaining the highest in-silico design success rates, structural diversity and novelty."}

In this work, we present SeedFold, a folding model that successfully scales up the model capacity. Our contributions are threefold: first, we identify an effective width-scaling strategy for the Pairformer to increase representation capacity; second, we introduce a novel linear triangular attention that reduces computational complexity to enable efficient scaling; finally, we construct a large-scale distillation dataset to substantially enlarge the training set. Experiments on FoldBench show that SeedFold outperforms AlphaFold3 on most protein-related tasks."}
