Abstract: Generative AI presents chemists with novel ideas for drug design and
facilitates the exploration of vast chemical spaces. Diffusion models (DMs), an
emerging tool, have recently attracted great attention in drug R\&D. This paper
comprehensively reviews the latest advancements and applications of DMs in
molecular generation. It begins by introducing the theoretical principles of
DMs. Subsequently, it categorizes various DM-based molecular generation methods
according to their mathematical and chemical applications. The review further
examines the performance of these models on benchmark datasets, with a
particular focus on comparing the generation performance of existing 3D

### [2] [AmpLyze: A Deep Learning Model for Predicting the Hemolytic Concentration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08162)
*Peng Qiu,Hanqi Feng,Barnabas Poczos*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: AmpLyze是一种新型模型，通过预测红血球裂解（HC50）值并提供解释，改进了传统二分类的抗菌肽（AMP）毒性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AMP毒性评估模型仅提供‘有毒’或‘无毒’的二元结论，无法定量预测HC50值，限制了AMP药物的设计和筛选。

Method: 结合残基级别的ProtT5/ESM2嵌入和序列级别描述符，采用双分支结构和交叉注意力模块，使用对数双曲余弦损失函数训练。

Result: AmpLyze在PCC和MSE指标上优于现有模型，并通过消融实验验证了双分支和交叉注意力的重要性。

Conclusion: AmpLyze为AMP设计提供了定量、基于序列且可解释的毒性预测工具，有助于早期毒性筛选。

Abstract: Red-blood-cell lysis (HC50) is the principal safety barrier for
antimicrobial-peptide (AMP) therapeutics, yet existing models only say "toxic"
or "non-toxic." AmpLyze closes this gap by predicting the actual HC50 value
from sequence alone and explaining the residues that drive toxicity. The model
couples residue-level ProtT5/ESM2 embeddings with sequence-level descriptors in
dual local and global branches, aligned by a cross-attention module and trained
with log-cosh loss for robustness to assay noise. The optimal AmpLyze model
reaches a PCC of 0.756 and an MSE of 0.987, outperforming classical regressors
and the state-of-the-art. Ablations confirm that both branches are essential,
and cross-attention adds a further 1% PCC and 3% MSE improvement.
Expected-Gradients attributions reveal known toxicity hotspots and suggest
safer substitutions. By turning hemolysis assessment into a quantitative,
sequence-based, and interpretable prediction, AmpLyze facilitates AMP design
and offers a practical tool for early-stage toxicity screening.

### [3] [Unavailability of experimental 3D structural data on protein folding dynamics and necessity for a new generation of structure prediction methods in this context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08188)
*Aydin Wells,Khalique Newaz,Jennifer Morones,Jianlin Cheng,Tijana Milenković*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 研究整理了蛋白质折叠中间体的3D结构数据，并评估了现有方法（如AlphaFold2）对这些非天然结构的预测能力，发现现有方法效果有限，但新兴方法（结合折叠动力学特性）前景较好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质折叠中间体的3D结构数据稀缺，但对理解折叠动力学和疾病至关重要。研究旨在整合现有数据并评估现有方法的适用性。

Method: 通过文献搜索整理实验和计算获得的折叠中间体3D结构数据，并评估AlphaFold2等方法的预测能力。

Result: 发现仅6项研究提供中间体数据，AlphaFold2等方法对非天然结构预测效果不佳，但新兴方法（结合折叠动力学）显示出潜力。

Conclusion: 当前领域需进一步发展针对性方法，新兴技术为研究蛋白折叠动力学提供了方向。

Abstract: Motivation: Protein folding is a dynamic process during which a protein's
amino acid sequence undergoes a series of 3-dimensional (3D) conformational
changes en route to reaching a native 3D structure; the resulting 3D structural
conformations are called folding intermediates. While data on native 3D
structures are abundant, data on 3D structures of non-native intermediates
remain sparse, due to limitations of current technologies for experimental
determination of 3D structures. Yet, analyzing folding intermediates is crucial
for understanding folding dynamics and misfolding-related diseases. Hence, we
search the literature for available (experimentally and computationally
obtained) 3D structural data on folding intermediates, organizing the data in a
centralized resource. Additionally, we assess whether existing methods,
designed for predicting native structures, can also be utilized to predict
structures of non-native intermediates.
  Results: Our literature search reveals six studies that provide 3D structural
data on folding intermediates (two for post-translational and four for
co-translational folding), each focused on a single protein, with 2-4
intermediates. Our assessment shows that an established method for predicting
native structures, AlphaFold2, does not perform well for non-native
intermediates in the context of co-translational folding; a recent study on
post-translational folding concluded the same for even more existing methods.
Yet, we identify in the literature recent pioneering methods designed
explicitly to predict 3D structures of folding intermediates by incorporating
intrinsic biophysical characteristics of folding dynamics, which show promise.
This study assesses the current landscape and future directions of the field of
3D structural analysis of protein folding dynamics.
