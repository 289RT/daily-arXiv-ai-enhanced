Motivation: 虽然 AF3 在蛋白质结构预测方面表现出色，但其训练过程因计算和内存密集型操作、2D 注意力机制以及数据管道的限制而难以扩展。MegaFold 旨在解决这些瓶颈，提升训练效率。

Method: MegaFold 采用三种主要方法：1) 预缓存数据以减少 GPU 空闲时间；2) 使用 Triton 内核实现高效 EvoAttention；3) 对 AF3 中常见的小算子进行深度融合。

Result: 在 NVIDIA H200 和 AMD MI250 GPU 上，MegaFold 将 AF3 训练的内存占用降低 1.23 倍，训练速度提升 1.73 倍和 1.62 倍，同时支持更长的序列训练。

Conclusion: MegaFold 显著提升了蛋白质结构预测模型的训练效率和可扩展性，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models such as AlphaFold3 (AF3) push the
frontier of biomolecular modeling by incorporating science-informed
architectural changes to the transformer architecture. However, these advances
come at a steep system cost, introducing: compute- and memory-intensive
operators, 2D attention mechanisms, and retrieval-augmented data pipelines,
which collectively hinder the scalability of AF3 training. In this work, we
present MegaFold, a cross-platform system to accelerate AF3 training. MegaFold
tackles key bottlenecks through ahead-of-time caching to eliminate GPU idle
time from the retrieval-augmented data pipeline, Triton-based kernels for
memory-efficient EvoAttention on heterogeneous devices, and deep fusion for
common and critical small operators in AF3. Evaluation on both NVIDIA H200 and
AMD MI250 GPUs shows that MegaFold reduces peak memory usage of AF3 training by
up to 1.23$\times$ and improves per-iteration training time by up-to
1.73$\times$ and 1.62$\times$ respectively. More importantly, MegaFold enables
training on 1.35$\times$ longer sequence lengths compared to PyTorch baselines
without running out-of-memory, significantly improving the scalability of
modern protein folding models. We open source our code at

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to investigate the structural stability,
dynamic properties, and potential interactions among Amyloid Precursor Protein
(APP), Tau, and Alpha-synuclein through a series of molecular dynamics
simulations that integrate publicly available structural data, detailed
force-field parameters, and comprehensive analytical protocols. By focusing on
these three proteins, which are each implicated in various neurodegenerative
disorders, the study aims to elucidate how their conformational changes and
interprotein contact sites may influence larger biological processes. Through
rigorous evaluation of their folding behaviors, energetic interactions, and
residue-specific functions, this work contributes to the broader understanding
of protein aggregation mechanisms and offers insights that may ultimately guide
therapeutic intervention strategies.

Abstract: Molecular docking plays a crucial role in predicting the binding mode of
ligands to target proteins, and covalent interactions, which involve the
formation of a covalent bond between the ligand and the target, are
particularly valuable due to their strong, enduring binding nature. However,
most existing docking methods and deep learning approaches hardly account for
the formation of covalent bonds and the associated structural changes. To
address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for covalent docking,
CovDocker, which is designed to better capture the complexities of covalent
binding. We decompose the covalent docking process into three main tasks:
reactive location prediction, covalent reaction prediction, and covalent
docking. By adapting state-of-the-art models, such as Uni-Mol and Chemformer,
we establish baseline performances and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
benchmark in accurately predicting interaction sites and modeling the molecular
transformations involved in covalent binding. These results confirm the role of
the benchmark as a rigorous framework for advancing research in covalent drug
design. It underscores the potential of data-driven approaches to accelerate
the discovery of selective covalent inhibitors and addresses critical
challenges in therapeutic development.
