Motivation: 以往数学模型假设生物膜基质为均质，忽略了细胞外空间的详细机制理解。本研究旨在揭示生物膜基质异质性及其功能。

Method: 引入了新的细胞胶囊方法，将细菌胶囊视为低扩散相，模拟其对氧传输的影响。

Result: 研究发现厚胶囊/密基质排列可使局部氧传递减少约70%，表明其对生物膜早期发展中氧限制的影响。

Conclusion: 细胞胶囊模型揭示了生物膜结构的异质性及其对氧传输的显著影响，为早期生物膜发展中的氧限制研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: The extracellular matrix of biofilms presents a dense and intricate
architecture. Numerous biophysical properties of the matrix surrounding
microbial cells contribute to the heterogeneity of biofilms and their functions
at the microscale. Previous mathematical models assume the matrix to be
homogeneous, often overlooking the need for a detailed mechanistic
understanding of the extracellular space. In this theoretical study, we
introduce a novel cell-capsule approach to investigate geometric patterns in
biofilm morphology and predict their role in oxygen transport. The thickness of
the capsule and the arrangement of cell-capsule patterns can influence matrix
heterogeneity, providing a clear picture of biofilm structure. By incorporating
the bacterial capsule as a distinct, low-diffusivity phase, our novel
cell-capsule model reveals that this architecture acts as a significant
'resistance-in-series' barrier. We found that a thick capsule/dense matrix
arrangement can reduce local oxygen transfer by approximately 70%, a
substantial drop that may give drive further research into oxygen limitations
during early stage biofilm development.

### [2] [Predicting Protein-Nucleic Acid Flexibility Using Persistent Sheaf Laplacians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20788)
*Nicole Hayes,Ekaterina Merkurjev,Guo-Wei Wei*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的方法——持久层拉普拉斯（PSL）框架，用于预测蛋白质-核酸复合物的B因子。PSL结合了多尺度分析、代数拓扑和层理论，显著优于传统方法（如GNM和mFRI），在B因子预测中Pearson相关系数最高提升21%。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质-核酸复合物的灵活性对其结构和功能的理解至关重要，但传统方法（如GNM和ENM）难以捕捉多尺度相互作用，尤其是在复杂生物分子系统中。

Method: 采用PSL框架，结合多尺度分析、代数拓扑、组合拉普拉斯和层理论，通过谐波和非谐波光谱揭示数据的拓扑不变性和形状演化。

Result: 在三个多样性数据集（包括蛋白质-RNA和纯核酸结构）上测试，PSL显著优于GNM和mFRI，Pearson相关系数最高提升21%。

Conclusion: PSL表现出强大的鲁棒性和适应性，有望在突变影响分析和药物设计等更广泛的应用中发挥作用。

Abstract: Understanding the flexibility of protein-nucleic acid complexes, often
characterized by atomic B-factors, is essential for elucidating their
structure, dynamics, and functions, such as reactivity and allosteric pathways.
Traditional models such as Gaussian Network Models (GNM) and Elastic Network
Models (ENM) often fall short in capturing multiscale interactions, especially
in large or complex biomolecular systems. In this work, we apply the Persistent
Sheaf Laplacian (PSL) framework for the B-factor prediction of protein-nucleic
acid complexes. The PSL model integrates multiscale analysis, algebraic
topology, combinatoric Laplacians, and sheaf theory for data representation. It
reveals topological invariants in its harmonic spectra and captures the
homotopic shape evolution of data with its non-harmonic spectra. Its
localization enables accurate B-factor predictions. We benchmark our method on
three diverse datasets, including protein-RNA and nucleic-acid-only structures,
and demonstrate that PSL consistently outperforms existing models such as GNM
and multiscale FRI (mFRI), achieving up to a 21% improvement in Pearson
correlation coefficient for B-factor prediction. These results highlight the
robustness and adaptability of PSL in modeling complex biomolecular
interactions and suggest its potential utility in broader applications such as
mutation impact analysis and drug design.

### [3] [BadGraph: A Backdoor Attack Against Latent Diffusion Model for Text-Guided Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20792)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了BadGraph，一种针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的后门攻击方法，通过文本触发植入后门，实验证明其高效且隐蔽。

Result: 低至10%的污染率可达到50%攻击成功率，24%可达80%，对良性样本性能影响微小。

Conclusion: 揭示文本引导图生成扩散模型的安全漏洞，强调在药物发现等应用中亟需防御此类后门攻击。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.
