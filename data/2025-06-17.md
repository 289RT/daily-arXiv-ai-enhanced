Motivation: 探索Acronychia pedunculata植物在斯里兰卡的抗菌潜力，特别是针对常见细菌的抗菌活性。

Method: 使用琼脂圆盘扩散生物测定技术，测试植物不同部位（叶、茎皮、花、种子、根）的三种溶剂提取物（己烷、氯仿、甲醇）对两种革兰氏阳性菌（金黄色葡萄球菌和蜡样芽孢杆菌）和两种革兰氏阴性菌（铜绿假单胞菌和大肠杆菌）的抗菌效果。

Result: 所有提取物对革兰氏阴性菌无抗菌作用。对革兰氏阳性菌，花提取物显示出最强的抗菌活性，尤其是甲醇花提取物。对不同细菌的效力排序也进行了详细描述。

Conclusion: Acronychia pedunculata的花提取物对革兰氏阳性菌具有显著抗菌活性，为未来抗菌药物开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: This study accessed the antibacterial potential in vitro of hexane,
chloroform and methanol extracts made from leaves, stem bark, flowers, seeds or
roots of Sri Lankan grown Acronychia pedunculata plant against two Gram
positive bacteria, Staphylococus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Bacilus cereus (ATCC
11778), and two Gram negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) and
Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), using agar disc diffusion bioassay technique.
The results showed that none the of the extracts provoked an antibacterial
action against the two Gram negative bacteria P. aeruginosa and E. coli.
Conversely, compared to reference drug, Gentamicin, varying magnitudes of
antibacterial activity (concentration: 300 mg/disc) ranging from zero to mild
to moderate to strong antibacterial activity was evident with the three solvent
systems made from different parts of the plant against the two Gram positive
bacteria S. aureus and B. cereus. All the three flower extracts excerted marked
antibacterial activity against both S. aureus and B. cereus. The highest
antibacterial activity was exhibited by methanol flowers extract (inhibition
zone: 13.8-0.32mm), with a Minimum inhibitory value of 32mg/ml, against B.
cereus. The overall order of potency against S. aureus was, chloroform flowers>
chloroform seeds > hexane leaves > chloroform leaves > methanol flowers> hexane
flowers> methanol seeds. And against B. cereus was methanol flowers> hexane
leaves > hexane flowers> chloroform leaves >chloroform flowers >chloroform
seeds > hexane roots > chloroform roots > methanol seeds chloroform stem barks
= hexane stem barks. These are all novel findings for A. pedunculata found in
Sri Lanka and elsewhere.

*Anupma Pandey,Megha,Nishant Kumar,Ruchir Sahni,Gajendra P. S. Raghava*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了CBTOPE的改进版CBTOPE2，通过结合进化信息和溶剂可及性，显著提升了B细胞表位预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有B细胞表位预测方法在性能上表现不佳，尤其是训练数据集有限且过时，作者决定改进原有的CBTOPE方法。

Method: 使用二元谱、PSSM谱和RSA信息构建机器学习模型，并通过五折交叉验证进行优化。

Result: 模型性能从AUC 0.58提升至0.64，最终在独立验证集上表现优异。

Conclusion: CBTOPE2显著提升了预测性能，并提供了软件和网络服务器以支持疫苗研究。

Abstract: In 2009, our group pioneered a novel method CBTOPE for predicting
conformational B-cell epitopes in a protein from its amino acid sequence, which
received extensive citations from the scientific community. In a recent study,
Cia et al. (2023) evaluated the performance of conformational B-cell epitope
prediction methods on a well-curated dataset, revealing that most approaches,
including CBTOPE, exhibited poor performance. One plausible cause of this
diminished performance is that available methods were trained on datasets that
are both limited in size and outdated in content. In this study, we present an
enhanced version of CBTOPE, trained, tested, and evaluated using the
well-curated dataset from Cai et al. (2023). Initially, we developed machine
learning-based models using binary profiles, achieving a maximum AUC of 0.58 on
the validation dataset. The performance of our method improved significantly
from an AUC of 0.58 to 0.63 when incorporating evolutionary information in the
form of a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) profile. Furthermore, the
performance increased from an AUC of 0.63 to 0.64 when we integrated both the
PSSM profile and relative solvent accessibility (RSA). All models were trained,
tested, and optimized on the training dataset using five-fold cross-validation.
The final performance of our models was assessed using a validation or
independent dataset that was not used during hyperparameter optimization. To
facilitate scientific community working in the field of subunit vaccine, we
develop a standalone software and web server CBTOPE2
(https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cbtope2/).

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的非自回归肽段测序模型，结合了结构化蛋白质序列课程学习策略和自优化推理模块，显著减少了训练失败率，并在多个指标和物种上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非自回归模型（NATs）在肽段测序任务中表现优异，但依赖CTC损失函数导致训练复杂且易失败，需要优化。

Method: 采用结构化蛋白质序列课程学习策略，根据模型能力动态调整学习难度，并引入自优化推理模块迭代优化预测结果。

Result: 课程学习策略减少90%以上的NAT训练失败，模型在九个基准物种上比现有方法表现更好。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升肽段测序的准确性和训练稳定性，为NAT在蛋白质测序中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Peptide sequencing-the process of identifying amino acid sequences from mass
spectrometry data-is a fundamental task in proteomics. Non-Autoregressive
Transformers (NATs) have proven highly effective for this task, outperforming
traditional methods. Unlike autoregressive models, which generate tokens
sequentially, NATs predict all positions simultaneously, leveraging
bidirectional context through unmasked self-attention. However, existing NAT
approaches often rely on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss,
which presents significant optimization challenges due to CTC's complexity and
increases the risk of training failures. To address these issues, we propose an
improved non-autoregressive peptide sequencing model that incorporates a
structured protein sequence curriculum learning strategy. This approach adjusts
protein's learning difficulty based on the model's estimated protein
generational capabilities through a sampling process, progressively learning
peptide generation from simple to complex sequences. Additionally, we introduce
a self-refining inference-time module that iteratively enhances predictions
using learned NAT token embeddings, improving sequence accuracy at a
fine-grained level. Our curriculum learning strategy reduces NAT training
failures frequency by more than 90% based on sampled training over various data
distributions. Evaluations on nine benchmark species demonstrate that our
approach outperforms all previous methods across multiple metrics and species.

*Lorenzo Bini,Stephane Marchand-Maillet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LapDDPM是一种新颖的条件图扩散概率模型，用于生成高保真且生物学上可信的单细胞RNA测序（scRNA-seq）数据。该模型通过整合图表示与扩散模型，并引入光谱对抗扰动机制，显著提升了生成数据的质量和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: scRNA-seq数据的高维性、稀疏性和复杂的生物变异性使得生成高质量的合成数据具有挑战性。现有生成模型往往难以捕捉这些特性，且对细胞网络中的结构噪声不够鲁棒。

Method: LapDDPM结合了图表示和扩散模型，并引入了以下创新：1）利用Laplacian位置编码（LPEs）丰富潜在空间信息；2）开发了条件分数扩散模型以学习复杂分布；3）采用光谱对抗训练机制增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个scRNA-seq数据集上的实验表明，LapDDPM在生成高保真和生物学可信的细胞类型特异性样本方面表现出色。

Conclusion: LapDDPM为条件性scRNA-seq数据生成设立了新基准，为下游生物应用提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity and biologically plausible synthetic single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, especially with conditional control, is
challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, and complex biological
variations. Existing generative models often struggle to capture these unique
characteristics and ensure robustness to structural noise in cellular networks.
We introduce LapDDPM, a novel conditional Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model
for robust and high-fidelity scRNA-seq generation. LapDDPM uniquely integrates
graph-based representations with a score-based diffusion model, enhanced by a
novel spectral adversarial perturbation mechanism on graph edge weights. Our
contributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs)
to enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we
develop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and
generation from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique
spectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness
against structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq
datasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity
and generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples. LapDDPM sets
a new benchmark for conditional scRNA-seq data generation, offering a robust
tool for various downstream biological applications.

### [5] [Iterative Annealing Mechanism for Protein and RNA Chaperones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12645)
*Changbong Hyeon,D. Thirumalai*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

Method: 采用迭代退火机制（IAM）作为理论框架，分析了蛋白质和RNA伴侣的结构和作用。

Result: 理论预测，RNA伴侣在中等活性水平时，自剪接前RNA的产量在体内达到最大化。

Conclusion: 分子伴侣通过IAM机制最大化生物时间内稳态产物的产量，RNA伴侣的活性水平对其效率至关重要。

Abstract: Molecular chaperones are machines that consume copious amount of ATP to drive
misfolded proteins or RNA to fold into functionally competent native states.
Because the folding landscapes of biomolecules with complex native state
topology are rugged consisting of multiple minima that are separated by large
free energy barriers, folding occurs by the kinetic partitioning mechanism
according to which only a small fraction of the molecules reach the folded
state in biologically viable times. The rescue of such proteins and RNA require
chaperones. Although the protein and RNA chaperones are profoundly different in
their structure and action, the principles underlying their activity to produce
the folded structures can be understood using a unified theoretical framework
based on iterative annealing mechanism (IAM). Our theory shows that both these
machines have evolved to the maximize the production of the steady state yield
on biological times. Strikingly, theory predicts that only at a moderate level
of RNA chaperone activity is the yield of the self-splicing pre-RNA is
maximized in \textit{in vivo}.
