We introduce \\emph{Speak to a\nProtein}, a new capability that turns protein analysis into an interactive,\nmultimodal dialogue with an expert co-scientist. The AI system retrieves and\nsynthesizes relevant literature, structures, and ligand data; grounds answers\nin a live 3D scene; and can highlight, annotate, manipulate and see the\nvisualization. It also generates and runs code when needed, explaining results\nin both text and graphics. We demonstrate these capabilities on relevant\nproteins, posing questions about binding pockets, conformational changes, or\nstructure-activity relationships to test ideas in real-time. \\emph{Speak to a\nProtein} reduces the time from question to evidence, lowers the barrier to\nadvanced structural analysis, and enables hypothesis generation by tightly\ncoupling language, code, and 3D structures. \\emph{Speak to a Protein} is freely\naccessible at https://open.playmolecule.org."}
