### [1] [Modelling ion channels with a view towards identifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26728)
*Ivo Siekmann*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 聚合马尔可夫模型为多时间尺度的随机动态提供了灵活框架，常用于离子通道建模。然而，当模型参数超过最大可识别数量时，模型会变得不可识别。论文探讨了这一问题，并建议建模时结合额外数据以避免不可识别性。

Motivation: 研究聚合马尔可夫模型在离子通道建模中的应用，并解决模型参数过多导致的不可识别性问题，以提高模型的准确性和实用性。

Method: 通过Pólya枚举计算给定状态的聚合马尔可夫模型，分析参数数量对可识别性的影响，并以三态模型为例深入研究非可识别性。

Result: 发现当开放和关闭状态数量超过特定参数限制时，模型会变得不可识别。通过额外数据可以改善这一问题。

Conclusion: 建议在离子通道建模中结合直接反映构象动态的数据，而非仅依赖假设的生物物理状态转换，以避免模型不可识别性。

Abstract: Aggregated Markov models provide a flexible framework for stochastic dynamics
that develops on multiple timescales. For example, Markov models for ion
channels often consist of multiple open and closed state to account for "slow"
and "fast" openings and closings of the channel. The approach is a popular tool
in the construction of mechanistic models of ion channels - instead of viewing
model states as generators of sojourn times of a certain characteristic length,
each individual model state is interpreted as a representation of a distinct
biophysical state. We will review the properties of aggregated Markov models
and discuss the implications for mechanistic modelling. First, we show how the
aggregated Markov models with a given number of states can be calculated using
P\'olya enumeration However, models with $n_O$ open and $n_C$ closed states
that exceed the maximum number $2 n_O n_C$ of parameters are non-identifiable.
We will present two derivations for this classical result and investigate
non-identifiability further via a detailed analysis of the non-identifiable
fully connected three-state model. Finally, we will discuss the implications of
non-identifiability for mechanistic modelling of ion channels. We will argue
that instead of designing models based on assumed transitions between distinct
biophysical states which are modulated by ligand binding, it is preferable to
build models based on additional sources of data that give more direct insight
into the dynamics of conformational changes.

Abstract: mRNA design and optimization are important in synthetic biology and
therapeutic development, but remain understudied in machine learning.
Systematic optimization of mRNAs is hindered by the scarce and imbalanced data
as well as complex sequence-function relationships. We present RNAGenScape, a
property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework that iteratively updates
mRNA sequences within a learned latent manifold. RNAGenScape combines an
organized autoencoder, which structures the latent space by target properties
for efficient and biologically plausible exploration, with a manifold projector
that contracts each step of update back to the manifold. RNAGenScape supports
property-guided optimization and smooth interpolation between sequences, while
remaining robust under scarce and undersampled data, and ensuring that
intermediate products are close to the viable mRNA manifold. Across three real
mRNA datasets, RNAGenScape improves the target properties with high success
rates and efficiency, outperforming various generative or optimization methods
developed for proteins or non-biological data. By providing continuous,
data-aligned trajectories that reveal how edits influence function, RNAGenScape
establishes a scalable paradigm for controllable mRNA design and latent space
exploration in mRNA sequence modeling.
