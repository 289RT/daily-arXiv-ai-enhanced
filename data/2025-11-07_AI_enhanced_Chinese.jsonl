Protein aggregation resulting from this gain of function is\nlikely to be the cause of neuronal death. Two main mechanisms of aggregation\nhave been proposed: hydrogen bonding by polar-zipper formation and covalent\nbonding by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. In cell culture models of\nHuntington's disease, aggregates are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but\ncovalent bonds are also likely to occur. Nothing is known about the nature of\nthe bonds that stabilize the aggregates in the brain of patients with\nHuntington's disease. It seems that the nature of the bond stabilizing the\naggregates is one of the most important questions, as the answer would\ncondition the therapeutic approach to Huntington's disease.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4ea8\u5ef7\u987f\u75c5\u4e2d\u805a\u8c37\u6c28\u9170\u80fa\u6269\u5f20\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u805a\u96c6\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea8\u5ef7\u987f\u75c5\u4e2d\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u805a\u96c6\u5bfc\u81f4\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u805a\u96c6\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u80de\u57f9\u517b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6c22\u952e\u548c\u5171\u4ef7\u952e\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7ec6\u80de\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6c22\u952e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u805a\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5171\u4ef7\u952e\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u60a3\u8005\u8111\u5185\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u805a\u96c6\u7a33\u5b9a\u952e\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u5c06\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u4ea8\u5ef7\u987f\u75c5\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, these features encompass a wide range of information,\nranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and\ninteraction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex\ninterconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function\nprediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive\npre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce\nreconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low\nsemantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module\n(BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features.\nAdditionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label\nclassification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to\nselect the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein\nfunction prediction.
