Several deep learning predictors for this task have been proposed, but,\npresumably due to the scarcity of binding data, these methods underperform\ncomputationally expensive estimates based on empirical force fields. In\nresponse, we propose a transfer-learning approach that leverages advances in\nprotein sequence modeling and folding stability prediction for this task. The\nkey idea is to parameterize the binding energy as the difference between the\nfolding energy of the protein complex and the sum of the folding energies of\nits binding partners. We show that using a pre-trained inverse-folding model as\na proxy for folding energy provides strong zero-shot performance, and can be\nfine-tuned with (1) copious folding energy measurements and (2) more limited\nbinding energy measurements. The resulting predictor, StaB-ddG, is the first\ndeep learning predictor to match the accuracy of the state-of-the-art empirical\nforce-field method FoldX, while offering an over 1,000x speed-up."}
