However, these models typically demand substantial computational resources, time, and data for effective training. Given that such extensive resources are often inaccessible to many researchers and that life sciences data sets are frequently limited, we investigated whether small ANN models could achieve acceptable accuracy in protein-RNA prediction. We experimented with shallow feed-forward ANNs comprising two hidden layers and various non-linearities. These models did not utilize explicit structural information; instead, a sliding window approach was employed to implicitly consider the context of neighboring residues and bases. We explored different training techniques to address the issue of highly unbalanced data. Among the seven most popular non-linearities for feed-forward ANNs, only three: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Gated Linear Unit (GLU), and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) yielded converging models. Common re-balancing techniques, such as under- and over-sampling of training sets, proved ineffective, whereas increasing the volume of training data and using model ensembles significantly improved performance. The optimal context window size, balancing both false negative and false positive errors, was found to be approximately 30 residues and bases. Our findings indicate that high-accuracy protein-RNA binding prediction is achievable using computing hardware accessible to most educational and research institutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c0f\u578b\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ANN\uff09\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-RNA\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578bANN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u4e14\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5c0f\u578bANN\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6d45\u5c42\u524d\u9988ANN\uff08\u4e24\u5c42\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u9690\u5f0f\u8003\u8651\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u518d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "ReLU\u3001GLU\u548cTanh\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u518d\u5e73\u8861\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6700\u4f73\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a30\u4e2a\u6b8b\u57fa\u548c\u78b1\u57fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u578bANN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-RNA\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u6784\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

We introduce a physical quantity that quantifies the irreversibility of stochastic Langevin systems from the observation of individual molecules' displacements. Categorizing these displacements into a few groups based on their initial and final position allows us to measure irreversibility precisely without the need to know the forces and magnitude of the fluctuations acting on the system. Our model-free estimate of irreversibility is related to entropy production by a conditional fluctuation theorem and provides a lower bound to the average entropy production. We validate the method on single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments of proteins subject to force ramps. We show that irreversibility is sensitive to detailed features of the energy landscape underlying the protein folding dynamics and suggest how our methods can be employed to unveil key properties of protein folding processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5316\u6717\u4e4b\u4e07\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u4f4d\u79fb\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6d4b\u91cf\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e86\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6298\u53e0\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u548c\u8017\u6563\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6f5c\u529b\u53ca\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u5b50\u4f4d\u79fb\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u529b\u8c31\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5bf9\u6298\u53e0\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6298\u53e0\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6298\u53e0\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}
