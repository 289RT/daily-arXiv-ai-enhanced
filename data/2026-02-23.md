Motivation: 生命从非生命物质中产生的过程一直以来是科学的重大难题。希望通过实验测量理解这一物理机制，但缺乏标准和跨比较框架。

Method: 采用分子组装理论来量化分子复杂性，并提出标准化测量方法，以测试生命起源中的主要分子转变假设。

Result: 这种方法可以为生命起源研究提供严格的测试工具，并可能统一代谢优先和遗传优先的不同研究路径。

Conclusion: 分子复杂性的标准化测量有助于统一生命起源研究的不同方向，并为地外生命的探测提供理论基础。

Abstract: One of the longest standing open problems in science is how life arises from non-living matter. If it is possible to measure this transition in the lab, then it might be possible to understand the physical mechanisms by which the emergence of life occurs, which so far have evaded scientific understanding. A significant hurdle is the lack of standards or a framework for cross comparison across different experimental contexts and planetary environments. In this essay, I review current challenges in experimental approaches to origin of life chemistry, focusing on those associated with quantifying experimental selectivity versus de novo generation of molecular complexity, and I highlight new methods using molecular assembly theory to measure molecular complexity. This metrology-centered approach can enable rigorous testing of hypotheses about the cascade of major transitions in molecular order marking the emergence of life, while potentially bridging traditional divides between metabolism-first and genetics-first scenarios. Grounding the study of life's origins in measurable complexity has significant implications for the search for life beyond Earth, suggesting paths toward theory-driven detection of biological complexity in diverse planetary contexts. As the field moves forward, standardized measurements of molecular complexity may help unify currently disparate approaches to understanding how matter transforms to life. Much remains to be done in this exciting frontier.
