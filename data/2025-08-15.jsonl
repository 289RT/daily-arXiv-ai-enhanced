We present zERExtractor, an\nautomated and extensible platform for comprehensive extraction of\nenzyme-catalyzed reaction and activity data from scientific literature.\nzERExtractor features a unified, modular architecture that supports\nplug-and-play integration of state-of-the-art models, including large language\nmodels (LLMs), as interchangeable components, enabling continuous system\nevolution alongside advances in AI. Our pipeline combines domain-adapted deep\nlearning, advanced OCR, semantic entity recognition, and prompt-driven LLM\nmodules, together with human expert corrections, to extract kinetic parameters\n(e.g., kcat, Km), enzyme sequences, substrate SMILES, experimental conditions,\nand molecular diagrams from heterogeneous document formats. Through active\nlearning strategies integrating AI-assisted annotation, expert validation, and\niterative refinement, the system adapts rapidly to new data sources. We also\nrelease a large benchmark dataset comprising over 1,000 annotated tables and\n5,000 biological fields from 270 P450-related enzymology publications.\nBenchmarking demonstrates that zERExtractor consistently outperforms existing\nbaselines in table recognition (Acc 89.9%), molecular image interpretation (up\nto 99.1%), and relation extraction (accuracy 94.2%). zERExtractor bridges the\nlongstanding data gap in enzyme kinetics with a flexible, plugin-ready\nframework and high-fidelity extraction, laying the groundwork for future\nAI-powered enzyme modeling and biochemical knowledge discovery."}

VS has the potential to reduce\nthe cost and time needed for manual selection and wet-laboratory experiments.\nImproving the cost-effectiveness of virtual screening is a significant\nchallenge, aiming to explore larger compound libraries while maintaining lower\nscreening costs. Here, we present HelixVS, a structure-based VS platform\nenhanced by deep learning models. HelixVS integrates a precise deep\nlearning-based pose-scoring model and a pose-screening module into a\nmulti-stage VS process, enabling more effective screening of active compounds.\nCompared to classic molecular docking tools like Vina, HelixVS demonstrated\nsignificantly improved screening performance across nearly a hundred targets,\nachieving an average 2.6-fold higher enrichment factor (EF) and more than 10\ntimes faster screening speed. We applied HelixVS in four drug development\npipelines, targeting both traditional competitive drug-binding pockets and\nnovel protein-protein interaction interfaces. Wet-lab validations across these\npipelines consistently identified active compounds, with over 10% of the\nmolecules tested in wet labs demonstrating activity at uM or even nM levels.\nThis demonstrates the ability of HelixVS to identify high-affinity ligands for\nvarious targets and pockets. Furthermore, we provide a publicly available and\nfree version of HelixVS with limited computing power to assist drug development\nscientists in accelerating their drug discovery processes."}

Such fragmentation forces scientists to manage\nincompatible interfaces and specialized scripts, which can be a cumbersome and\nrepetitive process. To address this issue, a Full-pROcess druG dEsign ageNT,\nnamed FROGENT, has been proposed. Specifically, FROGENT utilizes a Large\nLanguage Model and the Model Context Protocol to integrate multiple dynamic\nbiochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and task-specific AI models.\nThis agentic framework allows FROGENT to execute complicated drug discovery\nworkflows dynamically, including component tasks such as target identification,\nmolecule generation and retrosynthetic planning. FROGENT has been evaluated on\neight benchmarks that cover various aspects of drug discovery, such as\nknowledge retrieval, property prediction, virtual screening, mechanistic\nanalysis, molecular design, and synthesis. It was compared against six\nincreasingly advanced ReAct-style agents that support code execution and\nliterature searches. Empirical results demonstrated that FROGENT triples the\nbest baseline performance in hit-finding and doubles it in interaction\nprofiling, significantly outperforming both the open-source model Qwen3-32B and\nthe commercial model GPT-4o. In addition, real-world cases have been utilized\nto validate the practicability and generalization of FROGENT. This development\nsuggests that streamlining the agentic drug discovery pipeline can\nsignificantly enhance researcher productivity."}

The radius of the spiral was shown to\nscale with motor density with an exponent of -1/3, while the frequency was\ntheoretically predicted to scale with an exponent of 4/3. While both the\nspiraling radius and frequency depend on motor density, the theory assumed\nindependence of filament length, and remained to be tested on cytoskeletal\nsystems other than actin-myosin. Here, we reconstitute dynein-driven\nmicrotubule spiraling and compare experiments to theory and numerical\nsimulations. We characterize the scaling laws of spiraling MTs and find the\nradius dependence on force density to be consistent with previous results.\nFrequency on the other hand scales with force density with an exponent of ~1/3,\ncontrary to previous predictions. We also predict that the spiral radius scales\nproportionally and the frequency scales inversely with filament length, both\nwith an exponent of ~1/3. A model of variable persistence length best explains\nthe length dependence observed in experiments. Our findings that reconcile\ntheory, simulations, and experiments improve our understanding of the role of\ncytoskeletal filament elasticity, mechanics of microtubule buckling and motor\ntransport and the physical principles of active filaments."}

Under such data scarcity, almost all existing\npipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently\noverfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an\nInformation-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic\nshortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.\nSpecifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the\ninformation density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking\nstrategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional\nde novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with\ngreater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the\noriginal TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate\nmolecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS\noptimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five\nphysics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of\nfreedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the\nzero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to\n64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal\nmol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus\n3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves\nstate-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation\nerror."}
