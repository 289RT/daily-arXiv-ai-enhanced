Their interactions -- hereafter\nreferred to as PhPIs (polyphenol-protein interactions) -- affect key processes\nsuch as nutrient bioavailability, antioxidant activity, and therapeutic\nefficacy. However, these interactions remain challenging due to the structural\ndiversity of polyphenols and the dynamic nature of protein binding. Traditional\nexperimental techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass\nspectrometry (MS), along with computational tools such as molecular docking and\nmolecular dynamics (MD), have offered important insights but face constraints\nin scalability, throughput, and reproducibility. This review explores how deep\nlearning (DL) is reshaping the study of PhPIs by enabling efficient prediction\nof binding sites, interaction affinities, and MD using high-dimensional bio-\nand chem-informatics data. While DL enhances prediction accuracy and reduces\nexperimental redundancy, its effectiveness remains limited by data\navailability, quality, and representativeness, particularly in the context of\nnatural products. We critically assess current DL frameworks for PhPIs analysis\nand outline future directions, including multimodal data integration, improved\nmodel generalizability, and development of domain-specific benchmark datasets.\nThis synthesis offers guidance for researchers aiming to apply DL in unraveling\nstructure-function relationships of polyphenols, accelerating discovery in\nnutritional science and therapeutic development."}
