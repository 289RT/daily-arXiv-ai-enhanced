We present an agentic end-to-end drug design framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) in conjunction with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to dynamically coordinate access to biochemical databases, modular toolchains, and task-specific AI models. The system integrates four state-of-the-art components: MaSIF (MaSIF-site and MaSIF-seed-search) for geometric deep learning-based identification of protein-protein interaction (PPI) sites, Rosetta for grafting protein fragments onto protein backbones to form mini proteins, ProteinMPNN for amino acid sequences redesign, and AlphaFold3 for near-experimental accuracy in complex structure prediction. Starting from a target structure, the framework supports de novo binder generation via surface analysis, scaffold grafting and pose construction, sequence optimization, and structure prediction.

Here we present a theoretical analysis of an unsupervised feature selection pipeline based on the Differentiable Information Imbalance (DII). We consider the specific case of structural and physico-chemical features describing a set of proteins. We show that if one considers the features as coordinates of a (hypothetical) statistical physics model, this model undergoes a phase transition as a function of the number of retained features. For physico-chemical descriptors, this transition is between a glass-like phase when the features are few and a liquid-like phase. The glass-like phase exhibits bimodal order-parameter distributions and Binder cumulant minima. In contrast, for structural descriptors the transition is less sharp. Remarkably, for physico-chemical descriptors the critical number of features identified from the DII coincides with the saturation of downstream binary classification performance.

Unlike in text, where repetition merely reduces readability, in proteins it undermines structural confidence and functional viability. To unify this problem, we present the first systematic study of repetition in PLMs. We first propose quantitative metrics to characterize motif-level and homopolymer repetition and then demonstrate their negative impact on folding reliability. To address this challenge, we propose UCCS (Utility-Controlled Contrastive Steering), which steers protein generation with a constrained dataset. Instead of naively contrasting high- vs. low-repetition sequences, we construct contrastive sets that maximize differences in repetition while tightly controlling for structural utility. This disentanglement yields steering vectors that specifically target repetition without degrading foldability. Injected at inference, these vectors consistently reduce repetition without retraining or heuristic decoding. Experiments with ESM-3 and ProtGPT2 in CATH, UniRef50, and SCOP show that our method outperforms decoding penalties and other baselines, substantially lowering repetition while preserving AlphaFold confidence scores.

SEISMO conditions each proposal on the full optimization trajectory, combining natural-language task descriptions with scalar scores and, when available, structured explanatory feedback. Across the Practical Molecular Optimization benchmark of 23 tasks, SEISMO achieves a 2-3 times higher area under the optimisation curve than prior methods, often reaching near-maximal task scores within 50 oracle calls.

Recent generative models have shown promise in accelerating simulations, yet they struggle with long-horizon generation due to architectural constraints, error accumulation, and inadequate modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics. We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals severe limitations in current models for long-horizon generation, while demonstrating that STAR-MD's joint spatio-temporal modeling enables robust dynamics simulation at biologically relevant timescales, paving the way for accelerated exploration of protein function.", "AI": {"tldr": "STAR-MD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSE(3)-\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5728\u86cb\u767d\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u662f\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u751f\u7269\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTAR-MD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u548c\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728ATLAS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5fae\u79d2\u7ea7\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "STAR-MD\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u751f\u7269\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u86cb\u767d\u529f\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Accurately aligning molecular structure with natural language is therefore essential for enabling large language models (LLMs) to reason about downstream chemical tasks. However, the substantial cost of human annotation makes it infeasible to construct large-scale, high-quality datasets of structure-grounded descriptions. In this work, we propose a fully automated annotation framework for generating precise molecular structure descriptions at scale. Our approach builds upon and extends a rule-based chemical nomenclature parser to interpret IUPAC names and construct enriched, structured XML metadata that explicitly encodes molecular structure. This metadata is then used to guide LLMs in producing accurate natural-language descriptions. Using this framework, we curate a large-scale dataset of approximately $163$k molecule-description pairs. A rigorous validation protocol combining LLM-based and expert human evaluation on a subset of $2,000$ molecules demonstrates a high description precision of $98.6\\%$. The resulting dataset provides a reliable foundation for future molecule-language alignment, and the proposed annotation method is readily extensible to larger datasets and broader chemical tasks that rely on structural descriptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u6ce8\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u662f\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u547d\u540d\u6cd5\u89e3\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u6790IUPAC\u540d\u79f0\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316XML\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6307\u5bfcLLMs\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u7ea6163k\u4e2a\u5206\u5b50-\u63cf\u8ff0\u5bf9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u63cf\u8ff0\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe98.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u66f4\u5e7f\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}
