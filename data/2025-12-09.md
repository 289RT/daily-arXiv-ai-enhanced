Abstract: Understanding how protein mutations affect protein structure is essential for advancements in computational biology and bioinformatics. We introduce PRIMRose, a novel approach that predicts energy values for each residue given a mutated protein sequence. Unlike previous models that assess global energy shifts, our method analyzes the localized energetic impact of double amino acid insertions or deletions (InDels) at the individual residue level, enabling residue-specific insights into structural and functional disruption. We implement a Convolutional Neural Network architecture to predict the energy changes of each residue in a protein mutation. We train our model on datasets constructed from nine proteins, grouped into three categories: one set with exhaustive double InDel mutations, another with approximately 145k randomly sampled double InDel mutations, and a third with approximately 80k randomly sampled double InDel mutations. Our model achieves high predictive accuracy across a range of energy metrics as calculated by the Rosetta molecular modeling suite and reveals localized patterns that influence model performance, such as solvent accessibility and secondary structure context. This per-residue analysis offers new insights into the mutational tolerance of specific regions within proteins and provides higher interpretable and biologically meaningful predictions of InDels' effects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测蛋白质-蛋白质结合亲和力对理解分子相互作用和设计治疗方法至关重要。

Method: 研究采用了Boltz-2模型，并将其调整为蛋白质-蛋白质亲和力回归模型，结合序列嵌入进行测试。

Result: Boltz-2-PPI在TCR3d和PPB-affinity数据集上表现不及序列模型，但结合两者可以带来互补提升。

Conclusion: 当前基于结构的表示方法在亲和力预测上表现不佳，但结合序列和结构模型可以互补。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-protein binding affinity is vital for understanding molecular interactions and designing therapeutics. We adapt Boltz-2, a state-of-the-art structure-based protein-ligand affinity predictor, for protein-protein affinity regression and evaluate it on two datasets, TCR3d and PPB-affinity. Despite high structural accuracy, Boltz-2-PPI underperforms relative to sequence-based alternatives in both small- and larger-scale data regimes. Combining embeddings from Boltz-2-PPI with sequence-based embeddings yields complementary improvements, particularly for weaker sequence models, suggesting different signals are learned by sequence- and structure-based models. Our results echo known biases associated with training with structural data and suggest that current structure-based representations are not primed for performant affinity prediction.

Conclusion: 研究结果为选择兼容现代架构的CG映射提供了实用指导，并促进了可转移CG模型的开发。

Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling enables molecular simulations to reach time and length scales inaccessible to fully atomistic methods. For classical CG models, the choice of mapping, that is, how atoms are grouped into CG sites, is a major determinant of accuracy and transferability. At the same time, the emergence of machine learning potentials (MLPs) offers new opportunities to build CG models that can in principle learn the true potential of the mean force for any mapping. In this work, we systematically investigate how the choice of mapping influences the representations learned by equivariant MLPs by studying liquid hexane, amino acids, and polyalanine. We find that when the length scales of bonded and nonbonded interactions overlap, unphysical bond permutations can occur. We also demonstrate that correctly encoding species and maintaining stereochemistry are crucial, as neglecting either introduces unphysical symmetries. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting CG mappings compatible with modern architectures and guide the development of transferable CG models.
