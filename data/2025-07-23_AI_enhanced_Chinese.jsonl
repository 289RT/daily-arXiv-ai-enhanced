In the\ncase of protein--nucleic acid mixtures, charge plays a key role but can have\ncontrasting effects on phase behavior. Attractive electrostatic interactions\nbetween oppositely charged macromolecules are screened by added salt, reducing\nthe driving force for coacervation. By contrast, base-pairing interactions\nbetween nucleic acids are diminished by charge repulsion and thus enhanced by\nadded salt, promoting associative phase separation. To explore this interplay,\nwe combine experiment and theory to map the complex phase behavior of a model\nsolution of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and self-complementary DNA nanostars (NS) as a\nfunction of temperature, ionic strength, and macromolecular composition.\nDespite having opposite salt dependences, we find that electrostatics and base\npairing cooperate to stabilize NS--PLL coacervation at high ionic strengths and\ntemperatures, leading to two-phase or three-phase coexistence under various\nconditions. We further observe a variety of kinetic pathways to phase\nseparation at different salt concentrations, resulting in the formation of\nnonequilibrium aggregates or droplets whose compositions evolve on long\ntimescales. Finally, we show that the cooperativity between electrostatics and\nbase pairing can be used to create multiphase coacervates that partition\nvarious NS species at intermediate salt concentrations. Our results illustrate\nhow the interplay between distinct interaction modes can greatly increase the\ncomplexity of the phase behavior relative to systems with a single type of\ninteraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u4e2d\u9759\u7535\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u78b1\u57fa\u914d\u5bf9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u76f8\u5206\u79bb\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u534f\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u76f8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u6838\u9178\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u4e2d\u591a\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9759\u7535\u548c\u78b1\u57fa\u914d\u5bf9\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u76f8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u4e92\u8865\u6216\u62ee\u6297\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u805a-L-\u8d56\u6c28\u9178\uff08PLL\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u4e92\u8865DNA\u7eb3\u7c73\u661f\uff08NS\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u79bb\u5b50\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u7ec4\u6210\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u9759\u7535\u548c\u78b1\u57fa\u914d\u5bf9\u5728\u9ad8\u79bb\u5b50\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u534f\u540c\u7a33\u5b9a\u76f8\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e24\u76f8\u6216\u4e09\u76f8\u5171\u5b58\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8def\u5f84\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u805a\u96c6\u4f53\u6216\u6db2\u6ef4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u534f\u540c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u76f8\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u76f8\u51dd\u805a\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}
