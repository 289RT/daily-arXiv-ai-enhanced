Traditional refinement pipelines such as Phenix.real_space_refine and Rosetta are computationally expensive, demand extensive manual tuning, and present a significant bottleneck for researchers. We present CryoNet.Refine, an end-to-end deep learning framework that automates and accelerates molecular structure refinement. Our approach utilizes a one-step diffusion model that integrates a density-aware loss function with robust stereochemical restraints, enabling rapid optimization of a structure against experimental data. CryoNet.Refine provides a unified and versatile solution capable of refining protein complexes as well as DNA/RNA-protein complexes. In benchmarks against Phenix.real_space_refine, CryoNet.Refine consistently achieves substantial improvements in both model-map correlation and overall geometric quality metrics. By offering a scalable, automated, and powerful alternative, CryoNet.Refine aims to serve as an essential tool for next-generation cryo-EM structure refinement.

These repeats are important for protein structure and function, motivating decades of algorithmic work on repeat identification. Recent work has shown that protein language models (PLMs) identify repeats, by examining their behavior in masked-token prediction. To elucidate their internal mechanisms, we investigate how PLMs detect both exact and approximate repeats. We find that the mechanism for approximate repeats functionally subsumes that of exact repeats. We then characterize this mechanism, revealing two main stages: PLMs first build feature representations using both general positional attention heads and biologically specialized components, such as neurons that encode amino-acid similarity. Then, induction heads attend to aligned tokens across repeated segments, promoting the correct answer. Our results reveal how PLMs solve this biological task by combining language-based pattern matching with specialized biological knowledge, thereby establishing a basis for studying more complex evolutionary processes in PLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08PLMs\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u68c0\u6d4b\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u91cd\u590d\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u548c\u751f\u7269\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u590d\u7247\u6bb5\uff08\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7247\u6bb5\u5bf9\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76PLMs\u5982\u4f55\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u91cd\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790PLMs\u5728\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u91cd\u590d\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "PLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548c\u751f\u7269\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u7f16\u7801\u6c28\u57fa\u9178\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "PLMs\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u548c\u751f\u7269\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u751f\u7269\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
