However current methods face inherent\nchallenges in integrating domain knowledge, limiting their performance in\nidentifying lead compounds with novel and valid binding mode. Here, we propose\nAutoLeadDesign, a lead compounds design framework that inspires extensive\ndomain knowledge encoded in large language models with chemical fragments to\nprogressively implement efficient exploration of vast chemical space. The\ncomprehensive experiments indicate that AutoLeadDesign outperforms baseline\nmethods. Significantly, empirical lead design campaigns targeting two\nclinically relevant targets (PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) demonstrate\nAutoLeadDesign's competence in de novo generation of lead compounds achieving\nexpert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their\nmechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we\nfind that AutoLeadDesign shares analogous mechanisms with fragment-based drug\ndesign which traditionally rely on the expert decision-making, further\nrevealing why it works. Overall, AutoLeadDesign offers an efficient approach\nfor lead compounds design, suggesting its potential utility in drug design."}

Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown\nimpressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often\nascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space.\nHowever, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing\nmore flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to\nadapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore,\nthe potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is\nunexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow\nmodel (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference\nprocedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design,\ndemonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to\nbaselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based\ngenerative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for\nmodel design."}

In this work, we propose a novel\npipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational\nspaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into\nMD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble\nlearning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of\ngenerated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative\nrepresentation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into\n2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use\nthree rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new\nconformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that\ninterpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained\nfrom steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that\nrepresenting proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying\nadvanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an\nefficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed\nframework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures."}
