While molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\nremain the in silico gold standard, its high computational cost limits\nscalability. We present DynaProt, a lightweight, SE(3)-invariant framework that\npredicts rich descriptors of protein dynamics directly from static structures.\nBy casting the problem through the lens of multivariate Gaussians, DynaProt\nestimates dynamics at two complementary scales: (1) per-residue marginal\nanisotropy as $3 \\times 3$ covariance matrices capturing local flexibility, and\n(2) joint scalar covariances encoding pairwise dynamic coupling across\nresidues. From these dynamics outputs, DynaProt achieves high accuracy in\npredicting residue-level flexibility (RMSF) and, remarkably, enables reasonable\nreconstruction of the full covariance matrix for fast ensemble generation.\nNotably, it does so using orders of magnitude fewer parameters than prior\nmethods. Our results highlight the potential of direct protein dynamics\nprediction as a scalable alternative to existing methods."}

Despite its wide utility, RMSD calculation is\noften challenged by inconsistent atom ordering, indistinguishable\nconfigurations in molecular clusters, and potential chirality inversion during\nalignment. These issues highlight the necessity of accurate atom-to-atom\ncorrespondence as a prerequisite for meaningful alignment. Traditional\napproaches often rely on heuristic cost matrices combined with the Hungarian\nalgorithm, yet these methods underutilize the rich intra-molecular structural\ninformation and may fail to generalize across chemically diverse systems. In\nthis work, we introduce OTMol, a method that formulates the molecular alignment\ntask as a fused supervised Gromov-Wasserstein (fsGW) optimal transport problem.\nBy leveraging the intrinsic geometric and topological relationships within each\nmolecule, OTMol eliminates the need for manually defined cost functions and\nenables a principled, data-driven matching strategy. Importantly, OTMol\npreserves key chemical features such as molecular chirality and bond\nconnectivity consistency. We evaluate OTMol across a wide range of molecular\nsystems, including Adenosine triphosphate, Imatinib, lipids, small peptides,\nand water clusters, and demonstrate that it consistently achieves low RMSD\nvalues while preserving computational efficiency. Importantly, OTMol maintains\nmolecular integrity by enforcing one-to-one mappings between entire molecules,\nthereby avoiding erroneous many-to-one alignments that often arise in comparing\nmolecular clusters. Our results underscore the utility of optimal transport\ntheory for molecular alignment and offer a generalizable framework applicable\nto structural comparison tasks in cheminformatics, molecular modeling, and\nrelated disciplines."}

We compiled a new dataset by\nleveraging existing aggregation propensity datasets and extracting geometric\nand physicochemical isolated peptide descriptors that act as proxies for\naggregate morphology.

While enhanced sampling methods can accelerate these\nsimulations, they rely on pre-defined collective variables that are often\ndifficult to identify. A recent generative model, LD-FPG, demonstrated that\nthis problem could be bypassed by learning to sample the static equilibrium\nensemble as all-atom deformations from a reference structure, establishing a\npowerful method for all-atom ensemble generation. However, while this approach\nsuccessfully captures a system's probable conformations, it does not model the\ntemporal evolution between them. Here we extend LD-FPG with a temporal\npropagator that operates within the learned latent space and compare three\nclasses: (i) score-guided Langevin dynamics, (ii) Koopman-based linear\noperators, and (iii) autoregressive neural networks. Within a unified\nencoder-propagator-decoder framework, we evaluate long-horizon stability,\nbackbone and side-chain ensemble fidelity, and functional free-energy\nlandscapes. Autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long\nrollouts; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when\nthe score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight\nbaseline that tends to damp fluctuations. These results clarify the trade-offs\namong propagators and offer practical guidance for latent-space simulators of\nall-atom protein dynamics."}
