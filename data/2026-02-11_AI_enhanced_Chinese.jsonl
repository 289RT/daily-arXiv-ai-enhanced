Classical models (Fick, Higuchi, Peppas) rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their accuracy in complex geometries and release mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel approach using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Bayesian PINNs (BPINNs) for predicting release from planar, 1D-wrinkled, and 2D-crumpled films. This approach uniquely integrates Fick's diffusion law with limited experimental data to enable accurate long-term predictions from short-term measurements, and is systematically benchmarked against classical drug release models. We embedded Fick's second law into PINN as loss with 10,000 Latin-hypercube collocation points and utilized previously published experimental datasets to assess drug release performance through mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), considering noisy conditions and limited-data scenarios. Our approach reduced mean error by up to 40% relative to classical baselines across all film types. The PINN formulation achieved RMSE <0.05 utilizing only the first 6% of the release time data (reducing 94% of release time required for the experiments) for the planar film. For wrinkled and crumpled films, the PINN reached RMSE <0.05 in 33% of the release time data. BPINNs provide tighter and more reliable uncertainty quantification under noise. By combining physical laws with experimental data, the proposed framework yields highly accurate long-term release predictions from short-term measurements, offering a practical route for accelerated characterization and more efficient early-stage drug release system formulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINNs\uff09\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afPINNs\uff08BPINNs\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u836f\u7269\u91ca\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u836f\u7269\u91ca\u653e\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Fick\u3001Higuchi\u3001Peppas\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u91ca\u653e\u673a\u5236\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Fick\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5d4c\u5165PINN\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u752810,000\u4e2a\u62c9\u4e01\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u914d\u7f6e\u70b9\u548c\u5df2\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MAE\u548cRMSE\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165BPINNs\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8584\u819c\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u964d\u4f4e40%\u3002PINN\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75286%\u7684\u91ca\u653e\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u5373\u8fbe\u5230RMSE <0.05\uff0cBPINNs\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u77ed\u671f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u957f\u671f\u91ca\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u836f\u7269\u91ca\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}
