Abstract: Molecular docking is a cornerstone of drug discovery, relying on
high-resolution ligand-bound structures to achieve accurate predictions.
However, obtaining these structures is often costly and time-intensive,
limiting their availability. In contrast, ligand-free structures are more
accessible but suffer from reduced docking performance due to pocket geometries
being less suited for ligand accommodation in apo structures. Traditional
methods for artificially inducing these conformations, such as molecular
dynamics simulations, are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce
Sesame, a generative model designed to predict this conformational change
efficiently. By generating geometries better suited for ligand accommodation at
a fraction of the computational cost, Sesame aims to provide a scalable
solution for improving virtual screening workflows.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy can now routinely deliver atomic resolution
structures for a variety of biological systems. The relevance and value of
these structures is directly related to their ability to help rationalize
experimental observables, which in turn depends on the quality of model built
into the density map. Coupling traditional model building tools with
physics-based methods, such as docking, simulation, and modern force fields,
has been shown to improve the quality of the resulting structures. Here, we
survey the landscape of these hybrid approaches, highlighting their usefulness
for medium- and low-resolution datasets, as well as for structures of small
molecules, and make the argument that the community stands to benefit from
their inclusion in model building and refinement workflows.

Abstract: The majority of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on the market are
produced using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells cultured at scale in
chemically defined cell culture medium. Because of the high costs associated
with mammalian cell cultures, obtaining high cell densities to produce high
product titers is desired. These bioprocesses require high concentrations of
nutrients in the basal media and periodically adding concentrated feed media to
sustain cell growth and therapeutic protein productivity. Unfortunately, the
desired or optimal nutrient concentrations of the feed media are often
solubility limited due to precipitation of chemical complexes that form in the
solution. Experimentally screening the various cell culture media
configurations which contain 50 to 100 compounds can be expensive and
laborious. This article lays the foundation for utilizing computational tools
to understand precipitation of nutrients in cell culture media by studying the
pairwise interactions between amino acids in thermodynamic models. Activity
coefficient data for one amino acid in water and amino acid solubility data of
two amino acids in water have been used to determine a single set of UNIFAC
group interaction parameters to predict the thermodynamic behavior of the
multi-component systems found in mammalian cell culture media. The data
collected in this study is, to our knowledge, the largest set of ternary system
amino acid solubility data reported to date. These amino acid precipitation
predictions have been verified with experimentally measured ternary and
quaternary amino acid solutions. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of our model
as a digital twin to identify optimal cell culture media compositions by
replacing empirical approaches for nutrient precipitation with computational
predictions based on thermodynamics of individual media components in complex
mixtures.

### [4] [Canonicalization of the E value from BLAST similarity search -- dissimilarity measure and distance function for a metric space of protein sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06849)
*Boryeu Mao*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 论文探讨了BLAST和FASTA等序列匹配算法中E值的调整问题，提出通过考虑自匹配来校正E值，从而改进序列相似性比较和聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列匹配工具中的E值和比对分数在不同查询结果的交叉比较中存在局限性，需要更精确的相似性和差异性度量方法。

Method: 提出调整E值以考虑查询和目标序列的自匹配，从而获得规范的相似性和差异性度量。

Result: 调整后的E值在聚类和子集选择中表现出更好的效果，且满足度量空间的公理化性质。

Conclusion: 规范化的E值更适合作为蛋白质序列度量空间的距离函数。

Abstract: Sequence matching algorithms such as BLAST and FASTA have been widely used in
searching for evolutionary origin and biological functions of newly discovered
nucleic acid and protein sequences. As parts of these search tools, alignment
scores and E values are useful indicators of the quality of search results from
querying a database of annotated sequences, whereby a high alignment score (and
inversely a low E value) reflects significant similarity between the query and
the subject (target) sequences. For cross-comparison of results from
sufficiently different queries however, the interpretation of alignment score
as a similarity measure and E value a dissimilarity measure becomes somewhat
nuanced, and prompts herein a judicious distinction of different types of
similarity. We show that an adjustment of E value to account for self-matching
of query and subject sequences corrects for certain ostensibly anomalous
similarity comparisons, resulting in canonical dissimilarity and similarity
measures that would be more appropriate for database applications, such as
all-on-all sequence alignment or selection of diverse subsets. In actual
practice, the canonicalization of E value dissimilarity improves clustering and
the diversity of subset selection. While both E value and the canonical E value
share positivity and symmetry, two of the four axiomatic properties of a metric
space, the canonical E value itself is also reflexive and meets the condition
of triangle inequality, thus an appropriate distance function for a metric
space of protein sequences.

### [5] [CAME-AB: Cross-Modality Attention with Mixture-of-Experts for Antibody Binding Site Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06465)

Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational
immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure
methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific
binding sites on the antigens-a dual limitation in representation and
prediction. In this paper, we propose CAME-AB, a novel Cross-modality Attention
framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding
site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities,
including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained
language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined
biochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance
adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module
that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance
and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE
module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We
additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to
explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and
generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive
experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB
consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including
Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of
multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes
are available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CAME-AB-C525
