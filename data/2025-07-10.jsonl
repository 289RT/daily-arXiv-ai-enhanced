Existing therapeutic strategies often suffer from systemic\ntoxicity, poor efficacy and fast-gained drug resistance. In this study, we\ndesigned a cyclic peptide system (c-RGDKYQ) that takes the advantage of the\noverexpression of tyrosinase in melanoma cells to trigger enzyme-mediated\noxidation and self-assembly. The assembled peptide nanostructures can\nselectively disrupt the actin cytoskeleton, impairing cancer cellular\nfunctions, e.g., motility, adhesion, and proliferation, ultimately leading to\napoptosis. This approach does not rely on external drug payloads or complex\ndelivery mechanisms. c-RGDKYQ exhibits high selectivity for melanoma cells,\nstrongly suppressing tumor growth in a murine model with minimal systemic\ntoxicity. Our findings illuminate that, through targeting tyrosinase, c-RGDKYQ\nmay be an enzyme-responsive alternative to conventional treatments for\nmelanoma."}

Unfortunately, progress has been hindered by the lack\nof large-scale and high-quality binding affinity labels. The widely used\nPDBbind dataset has fewer than 20K labeled complexes. Self-supervised learning,\nespecially graph contrastive learning (GCL), provides a unique opportunity to\nbreak the barrier by pre-training graph neural network models based on vast\nunlabeled complexes and fine-tuning the models on much fewer labeled complexes.\nHowever, the problem faces unique challenges, including a lack of a\ncomprehensive unlabeled dataset with well-defined positive/negative complex\npairs and the need to design GCL algorithms that incorporate the unique\ncharacteristics of such data. To fill the gap, we propose DecoyDB, a\nlarge-scale, structure-aware dataset specifically designed for self-supervised\nGCL on protein-ligand complexes. DecoyDB consists of high-resolution ground\ntruth complexes (less than 2.5 Angstrom) and diverse decoy structures with\ncomputationally generated binding poses that range from realistic to suboptimal\n(negative pairs). Each decoy is annotated with a Root Mean Squared Deviation\n(RMSD) from the native pose. We further design a customized GCL framework to\npre-train graph neural networks based on DecoyDB and fine-tune the models with\nlabels from PDBbind. Extensive experiments confirm that models pre-trained with\nDecoyDB achieve superior accuracy, label efficiency, and generalizability."}

We introduce the first\nautomated framework for labeling every neuron in a PLM with biologically\ngrounded natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches relying on\nsparse autoencoders or manual annotation, our method scales to hundreds of\nthousands of neurons, revealing individual neurons are selectively sensitive to\ndiverse biochemical and structural properties. We then develop a novel neuron\nactivation-guided steering method to generate proteins with desired traits,\nenabling convergence to target biochemical properties like molecular weight and\ninstability index as well as secondary and tertiary structural motifs,\nincluding alpha helices and canonical Zinc Fingers.

Recent large\nlanguage model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but\neffectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step\nplanning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce\nDeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic\nframework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional\ntemplate-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs\nin a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is\nattempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently\nproposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these\nsuggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks\nbefore the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for\nfurther evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway\nexploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline\nthrough benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to\nidentify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we\ndevelop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human\nchemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm. This\napproach successfully generates novel pathways for complex natural product\ncompounds, demonstrating the potential for iterative LLM reasoning to advance\nstate-of-art in complex chemical syntheses."}
