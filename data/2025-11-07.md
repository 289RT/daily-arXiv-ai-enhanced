### [1] [Protein aggregation in Huntington's disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04174)
*Guylaine Hoffner,Philippe Djian*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: 探讨亨廷顿病中聚谷氨酰胺扩张导致的蛋白质聚集机制及其对治疗策略的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亨廷顿病中蛋白质聚集导致神经元死亡，了解聚集机制对治疗策略至关重要。

Method: 通过细胞培养模型分析氢键和共价键的作用。

Result: 细胞模型中氢键主导聚集，但共价键也可能存在，患者脑内机制尚不清楚。

Conclusion: 明确聚集稳定键的类型将直接影响亨廷顿病的治疗方向。

Abstract: The presence of an expanded polyglutamine produces a toxic gain of function
in huntingtin. Protein aggregation resulting from this gain of function is
likely to be the cause of neuronal death. Two main mechanisms of aggregation
have been proposed: hydrogen bonding by polar-zipper formation and covalent
bonding by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. In cell culture models of
Huntington's disease, aggregates are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but
covalent bonds are also likely to occur. Nothing is known about the nature of
the bonds that stabilize the aggregates in the brain of patients with
Huntington's disease. It seems that the nature of the bond stabilizing the
aggregates is one of the most important questions, as the answer would
condition the therapeutic approach to Huntington's disease.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DSRPGO的多模态蛋白质功能预测方法，通过动态选择和重构预训练机制，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态蛋白质特征包含广泛信息，但其复杂关联性难以解析，现有方法难以充分利用这些特征。

Method: 采用重构预训练挖掘细粒度信息，提出双向交互模块（BInM）促进多模态特征交互学习，设计动态选择模块（DSM）优化特征表示选择。

Result: 在人类数据集上的BPO、MFO和CCO任务中显著优于其他基准模型。

Conclusion: DSRPGO通过创新机制有效解决了多模态蛋白质功能预测中的复杂性问题，并展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function
prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information,
ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and
interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex
interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function
prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive
pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce
reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low
semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module
(BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features.
Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label
classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to
select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein
function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO,
MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.
