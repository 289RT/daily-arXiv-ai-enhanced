A Dynamic Gaussian Network Model Study", "categories": ["q-bio.BM"], "comment": "8 Figures", "summary": "This research reports the entropy transfer throughout the tridimensional structure of PDZ-2 and TIM barrel structures using the dynamic Gaussian Network Model. The model predicts the allocation of the allosteric pathways of the PDZ-2. Moreover. A visualization analysis reveals that entropy and information is transported towards the effector site in PDZ-2 and near to the catalytic site of the TIM-Barrel protein. The results suggest the presence of a functional hierarchy that determine information and entropy flow directionality."}

To address this challenge, we introduce FuncBind, a framework based on computer vision to generate target-conditioned, all-atom molecules across atomic systems. FuncBind uses neural fields to represent molecules as continuous atomic densities and employs score-based generative models with modern architectures adapted from the computer vision literature. This modality-agnostic representation allows a single unified model to be trained on diverse atomic systems, from small to large molecules, and handle variable atom/residue counts, including non-canonical amino acids. FuncBind achieves competitive in silico performance in generating small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody complementarity-determining region loops, conditioned on target structures. FuncBind also generated in vitro novel antibody binders via de novo redesign of the complementarity-determining region H3 loop of two chosen co-crystal structures. As a final contribution, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for structure-conditioned macrocyclic peptide generation. The code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/funcbind."}
