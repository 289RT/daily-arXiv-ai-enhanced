However, recent studies show some DDXs can also unwind dsRNA without ATP, a phenomenon that remains poorly understood. Here, we developed HelixTriad coarse-grained RNA model, incorporating Watson-Crick base pairing, base stacking, and electrostatics within a three-bead-per-nucleotide scheme to accurately reproduce experimental RNA melting curves. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that weak, specific DDX3X-dsRNA interactions drive stochastic strand separation without ATP. Free energy analysis revealed that successful unwinding via high-entropy, stand-displacing intermediates. Furthermore, we introduced Entropy-Unet, a deep learning framework for entropy prediction, which corroborated theoretical estimates and uncovered a hierarchical pattern of entropy contributions. Together, our findings suggest that ATP-independent dsRNA unwinding by DDXs is predominantly entropy-driven, offering new mechanistic insights into RNA helicases versatility.", "AI": {"tldr": "DEAD-box RNA helic\u9176\uff08DDXs\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56ATP\u89e3\u65cb\u53cc\u94feRNA\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0DDX3X\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u65e0ATP\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u968f\u673a\u89e3\u65cb\u3002HelixTriad\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eEntropy-Unet\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76DDXs\u5728\u65e0ATP\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u89e3\u65cb\u53cc\u94feRNA\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1HelixTriad\u7c97\u7c92\u5316RNA\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7194\u89e3\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Entropy-Unet\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0DDX3X\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u9ad8\u71b5\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0ATP\u89e3\u65cb\uff0c\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "DDXs\u7684\u65e0ATP\u89e3\u65cb\u80fd\u529b\u7531\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9RNA\u89e3\u65cb\u9176\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Efficiently identifying specific enzymes from vast protein libraries is essential for advancing biocatalysis. Traditional computational methods for enzyme screening and retrieval are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Recently, deep learning approaches have shown promise. However, these methods focus solely on the interaction between enzymes and reactions, overlooking the inherent hierarchical relationships within each domain. To address these limitations, we introduce FGW-CLIP, a novel contrastive learning framework based on optimizing the fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance. FGW-CLIP incorporates multiple alignments, including inter-domain alignment between reactions and enzymes and intra-domain alignment within enzymes and reactions. By introducing a tailored regularization term, our method minimizes the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between enzyme and reaction spaces, which enhances information integration across these domains. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of FGW-CLIP in challenging enzyme-reaction tasks. On the widely-used EnzymeMap benchmark, FGW-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance in enzyme virtual screening, as measured by BEDROC and EF metrics. Moreover, FGW-CLIP consistently outperforms across all three splits of ReactZyme, the largest enzyme-reaction benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization to novel enzymes and reactions. These results position FGW-CLIP as a promising framework for enzyme discovery in complex biochemical settings, with strong adaptability across diverse screening scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "FGW-CLIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u878d\u5408Gromov-Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u63d0\u5347\u9176\u53cd\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u9176\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u9886\u57df\u5185\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\uff0cFGW-CLIP\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u878d\u5408Gromov-Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57df\u95f4\u548c\u57df\u5185\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728EnzymeMap\u548cReactZyme\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFGW-CLIP\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9886\u5148\u3002", "conclusion": "FGW-CLIP\u662f\u590d\u6742\u751f\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9176\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
