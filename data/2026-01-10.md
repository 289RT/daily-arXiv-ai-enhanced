TL;DR: 研究了组胺在水溶液中的局部结构和扩散行为，发现局部结构主要由库仑相互作用和氢键决定，与水模型无关；扩散行为则显著依赖于水模型，SPC/E模型更适合模拟生理条件下的动力学特性。

Motivation: 探究组胺在水溶液中的结构和动力学特性，明确不同水模型对模拟结果的影响。

Method: 使用TIP3P和SPC/E水模型进行分子动力学模拟，分析局部结构和扩散行为。

Result: 局部结构与水模型无关，扩散行为受水模型显著影响；SPC/E模型更接近实验数据。

Conclusion: SPC/E水模型更适合描述组胺-水系统的动力学特性。

Abstract: A highly diluted aqueous solution of histamine was studied by molecular dynamics using the TIP3P and SPC/E water models. It was shown that the local structure of the solution around histamine is determined by local Coulomb interactions and hydrogen bonds and is practically independent of the choice of the water model. Dynamic analysis based on the mean square displacement functions revealed a significant dependence of the diffusion behavior of histamine on the water model. It was found that the TIP3P water model leads to overestimated values of the diffusion coefficients of water and histamine and a transition to the diffusion mode of motion. It was found that the SPC/E water model provides slower dynamics of the solution components, and the values of the diffusion coefficients are in better agreement with experimental data. It was shown that the dynamics of histamine is highly sensitive to the choice of the water model, and the SPC/E model is more suitable for the correct description of the dynamic properties of the ``histamine--water'' system under physiological conditions.
