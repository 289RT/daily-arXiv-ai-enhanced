  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质-配体相互作用预测方法难以捕捉溶剂依赖性构象变化，且缺乏多任务联合学习能力，限制了其在计算机辅助药物发现中的应用。

Method: 引入了一种预训练方法，整合了分子重构（捕捉局部几何结构）、原子间距离预测（建模空间关系）和对比学习（构建溶剂不变分子表示）。

Result: 该方法在结合亲和力预测上提高了3.7%，在PoseBusters Astex对接基准测试中成功率达到了82%，在虚拟筛选中曲线下面积为97.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法支持溶剂感知和多任务建模，并在基准测试中表现一致，为结构药物设计提供了原子级别的见解。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions is essential for
computer-aided drug discovery. However, existing methods often fail to capture
solvent-dependent conformational changes and lack the ability to jointly learn
multiple related tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a
pre-training method that incorporates ligand conformational ensembles generated
under diverse solvent conditions as augmented input. This design enables the
model to learn both structural flexibility and environmental context in a
unified manner. The training process integrates molecular reconstruction to
capture local geometry, interatomic distance prediction to model spatial
relationships, and contrastive learning to build solvent-invariant molecular
representations. Together, these components lead to significant improvements,
including a 3.7% gain in binding affinity prediction, an 82% success rate on
the PoseBusters Astex docking benchmarks, and an area under the curve of 97.1%
in virtual screening. The framework supports solvent-aware, multi-task modeling
and produces consistent results across benchmarks. A case study further
demonstrates sub-angstrom docking accuracy with a root-mean-square deviation of
0.157 angstroms, offering atomic-level insight into binding mechanisms and
advancing structure-based drug design.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: Pi-SAGE是一个新型的蛋白质表面感知图编码器，通过显式结合蛋白质表面特征提升结合亲和力变化预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型（如GearBind）仅基于蛋白质结构隐式学习表面特征，而显式的表面特征可能提升预测能力。

Method: 训练Pi-SAGE生成蛋白质表面码本并标记表面残基，将其特征与GearBind结合用于SKEMPI数据集。

Result: 显式结合局部化学特征提升了全原子图神经网络在预测结合亲和力变化中的性能。

Conclusion: 显式表面特征能增强结构模型的预测能力，Pi-SAGE提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Protein surface fingerprint encodes chemical and geometric features that
govern protein-protein interactions and can be used to predict changes in
binding affinity between two protein complexes. Current state-of-the-art models
for predicting binding affinity change, such as GearBind, are all-atom based
geometric models derived from protein structures. Although surface properties
can be implicitly learned from the protein structure, we hypothesize that
explicit knowledge of protein surfaces can improve a structure-based model's
ability to predict changes in binding affinity. To this end, we introduce
Pi-SAGE, a novel Permutation-Invariant Surface-Aware Graph Encoder. We first
train Pi-SAGE to create a protein surface codebook directly from the structure
and assign a token for each surface-exposed residue. Next, we augment the node
features of the GearBind model with surface features from domain-adapted
Pi-SAGE to predict binding affinity change on the SKEMPI dataset. We show that
explicitly incorporating local, context-aware chemical properties of residues
enhances the predictive power of all-atom graph neural networks in modeling
binding affinity changes between wild-type and mutant proteins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集多关注分子级别属性预测，忽略了功能组信息的重要性，FGBench填补了这一空白，为构建更可解释的LLMs提供支持。

Method: 构建包含625K分子属性推理问题的FGBench数据集，精确标注功能组，涵盖回归和分类任务。

Result: 测试显示当前LLMs在功能组级别的推理能力不足，凸显提升需求。

Conclusion: FGBench为LLMs理解分子结构与属性关系提供了基础框架，推动化学任务发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry.
However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction
and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information.
Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links
molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more
interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks.
Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden
relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties,
thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce
FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with
functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and
localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability
thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both
regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across
three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group
impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular
comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the
results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,
highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry
tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct
datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational
framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better
understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset
and evaluation code are available at
