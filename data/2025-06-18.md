Motivation: 在早期药物发现中，受体基分子设计是关键，但现有方法难以同时满足几何匹配和化学合成约束。

Method: READ首次将分子检索增强生成与SE(3)-等变扩散模型结合，通过对比预训练的编码器在推理时检索口袋匹配的支架以指导扩散步骤。

Result: 实验表明READ在CBGBench中表现优异，超越了现有生成模型甚至原生配体。

Conclusion: 检索与扩散的联合优化为基于结构的药物设计提供了更快、更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Breakthroughs in high-accuracy protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have established receptor-based molecule design as a critical driver for rapid early-phase drug discovery. However, most approaches still struggle to balance pocket-specific geometric fit with strict valence and synthetic constraints. To resolve this trade-off, a Retrieval-Enhanced Aligned Diffusion termed READ is introduced, which is the first to merge molecular Retrieval-Augmented Generation with an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model. Specifically, a contrastively pre-trained encoder aligns atom-level representations during training, then retrieves graph embeddings of pocket-matched scaffolds to guide each reverse-diffusion step at inference. This single mechanism can inject real-world chemical priors exactly where needed, producing valid, diverse, and shape-complementary ligands. Experimental results demonstrate that READ can achieve very competitive performance in CBGBench, surpassing state-of-the-art generative models and even native ligands. That suggests retrieval and diffusion can be co-optimized for faster, more reliable structure-based drug design.
