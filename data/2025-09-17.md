Abstract: Protein design has the potential to revolutionize biotechnology and medicine.
While most efforts have focused on proteins with well-defined structures,
increased recognition of the functional significance of intrinsically
disordered regions, together with improvements in their modeling, has paved the
way to their computational de novo design. This review summarizes recent
advances in engineering intrinsically disordered regions with tailored
conformational ensembles, molecular recognition, and phase behavior. We discuss
challenges in combining models with predictive accuracy with scalable design
workflows and outline emerging strategies that integrate knowledge-based,
physics-based, and machine-learning approaches.

Abstract: The scarcity of experimental protein-ligand complexes poses a significant
challenge for training robust deep learning models for molecular docking. Given
the prohibitive cost and time constraints associated with experimental
structure determination, scalable generation of realistic protein-ligand
complexes is needed to expand available datasets for model development. In this
study, we introduce a novel workflow for the procedural generation and
validation of synthetic protein-ligand complexes, combining a diverse ensemble
of generation techniques and rigorous quality control. We assessed the utility
of these synthetic datasets by retraining established docking models, Smina and
Gnina, and evaluating their performance on standard benchmarks including the
PDBBind core set and the PoseBusters dataset. Our results demonstrate that
models trained on synthetic data achieve performance comparable to models
trained on experimental data, indicating that current synthetic complexes can
effectively capture many salient features of protein-ligand interactions.
However, we did not observe significant improvements in docking or scoring
accuracy over conventional methods or experimental data augmentation. These
findings highlight the promise as well as the current limitations of synthetic
data for deep learning-based molecular docking and underscore the need for
further refinement in generation methodologies and evaluation strategies to
fully exploit the potential of synthetic datasets for this application.

Abstract: Fragment-based drug design is a promising strategy leveraging the binding of
small chemical moieties that can efficiently guide drug discovery. The initial
step of fragment identification remains challenging, as fragments often bind
weakly and non-specifically. We developed a protein-fragment encoder that
relies on a contrastive learning approach to map both molecular fragments and
protein surfaces in a shared latent space. The encoder captures
interaction-relevant features and allows to perform virtual screening as well
as generative design with our new method LatentFrag. In LatentFrag, fragment
embeddings and positions are generated conditioned on the protein surface while
being chemically realistic by construction. Our expressive fragment and protein
representations allow location of protein-fragment interaction sites with high
sensitivity and we observe state-of-the-art fragment recovery rates when
sampling from the learned distribution of latent fragment embeddings. Our
generative method outperforms common methods such as virtual screening at a
fraction of its computational cost providing a valuable starting point for
fragment hit discovery. We further show the practical utility of LatentFrag and
extend the workflow to full ligand design tasks. Together, these approaches
contribute to advancing fragment identification and provide valuable tools for
fragment-based drug discovery.

Abstract: Unraveling the dynamical motions of biomolecules is essential for bridging
their structure and function, yet it remains a major computational challenge.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a detailed depiction of
biomolecular motion, but its high-resolution temporal evolution comes at
significant computational cost, limiting its applicability to timescales of
biological relevance. Deep learning approaches have emerged as promising
solutions to overcome these computational limitations by learning to predict
long-timescale dynamics. However, generalizable kinetics models for proteins
remain largely unexplored, and the fundamental limits of achievable
acceleration while preserving dynamical accuracy are poorly understood. In this
work, we fill this gap with DeepJump, an Euclidean-Equivariant Flow
Matching-based model for predicting protein conformational dynamics across
multiple temporal scales. We train DeepJump on trajectories of the diverse
proteins of mdCATH, systematically studying our model's performance in
generalizing to long-term dynamics of fast-folding proteins and characterizing
the trade-off between computational acceleration and prediction accuracy. We
demonstrate the application of DeepJump to ab initio folding, showcasing
prediction of folding pathways and native states. Our results demonstrate that
DeepJump achieves significant $\approx$1000$\times$ computational acceleration
while effectively recovering long-timescale dynamics, providing a stepping
stone for enabling routine simulation of proteins.
