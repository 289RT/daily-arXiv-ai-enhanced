In this work, we investigate the potential of\nActivation Steering, a technique originally developed for controlling text\ngeneration in Large Language Models (LLMs), to direct PLMs toward generating\nprotein sequences with targeted properties. We propose a simple yet effective\nmethod that employs activation editing to steer PLM outputs, and extend this\napproach to protein optimization through a novel editing site identification\nmodule. Through comprehensive experiments on lysozyme-like sequence generation\nand optimization, we demonstrate that our methods can be seamlessly integrated\ninto both auto-encoding and autoregressive PLMs without requiring additional\ntraining. These results highlight a promising direction for precise protein\nengineering using foundation models."}

Dreyer"], "title": "Tokenizing Loops of Antibodies", "categories": ["q-bio.BM", "cs.LG"], "comment": "21 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables, code available at\n  https://github.com/prescient-design/igloo", "summary": "The complementarity-determining regions of antibodies are loop structures\nthat are key to their interactions with antigens, and of high importance to the\ndesign of novel biologics. Since the 1980s, categorizing the diversity of CDR\nstructures into canonical clusters has enabled the identification of key\nstructural motifs of antibodies. However, existing approaches have limited\ncoverage and cannot be readily incorporated into protein foundation models.\nHere we introduce ImmunoGlobulin LOOp Tokenizer, Igloo, a multimodal antibody\nloop tokenizer that encodes backbone dihedral angles and sequence. Igloo is\ntrained using a contrastive learning objective to map loops with similar\nbackbone dihedral angles closer together in latent space. Igloo can efficiently\nretrieve the closest matching loop structures from a structural antibody\ndatabase, outperforming existing methods on identifying similar H3 loops by\n5.9\\%. Igloo assigns tokens to all loops, addressing the limited coverage issue\nof canonical clusters, while retaining the ability to recover canonical loop\nconformations. To demonstrate the versatility of Igloo tokens, we show that\nthey can be incorporated into protein language models with IglooLM and\nIglooALM. On predicting binding affinity of heavy chain variants, IglooLM\noutperforms the base protein language model on 8 out of 10 antibody-antigen\ntargets. Additionally, it is on par with existing state-of-the-art\nsequence-based and multimodal protein language models, performing comparably to\nmodels with $7\\times$ more parameters. IglooALM samples antibody loops which\nare diverse in sequence and more consistent in structure than state-of-the-art\nantibody inverse folding models. Igloo demonstrates the benefit of introducing\nmultimodal tokens for antibody loops for encoding the diverse landscape of\nantibody loops, improving protein foundation models, and for antibody CDR\ndesign."}

Above the glass\ntransition temperature, they undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. Using the\nnovel EPR technique called intermolecular hyperfine Relaxation-Induced Dipolar\nModulation Enhancement (ih-RIDME), we quantified the molar composition in\nfrozen water/glycerol mixtures with one or the other component deuterated after\nthe phase transition. Our experiments reveal nearly equal phase composition\nregardless of the proton/deuterium isotope balance. With the new ih-RIDME data,\nwe can also revisit the already reported body of glass transition data for such\nmixtures and build a consistent picture for water/glycerol freezing and phase\ntransitions. Our results also indicate that ih-RIDME has the potential for\ninvestigating the solvation shells of spin-labelled macromolecules."}
